GATE_SUMMARY,,,,,,,
T+24h_infrastructure,,,0/4_apps_passing,All 4 apps at 1/5 (universal /canary blocker),24h_with_parallel,"scholarship_api, scholar_auth, scholarship_agent, scholarship_sage all need /canary. scholar_auth also needs JWKS fix (6-8h critical path)."
T+48h_revenue,,,0/2_apps_passing,Both revenue apps at 1/5 (depend on scholar_auth),10h_from_now,"student_pilot + provider_register both need /canary (2-3h each). BLOCKED by scholar_auth JWKS (6-8h). Parallel execution: revenue possible 8-10h from now."
T+72h_SEO,,,0/1_apps_passing,auto_page_maker at 1/5 (needs 5/5),8h,"SEO gate requires perfection. auto_page_maker needs /canary + full SEO headers + sitemap. Lower priority than revenue apps."

UNIVERSAL_BLOCKER,,,,,,,
finding,,,/canary_missing_all_8_apps,"0/8 apps have working JSON /canary",2-10h_per_app,"Universal /canary requirement new in v2.2. ALL apps fail hard cap: missing or non-JSON → 1/5. Root cause: SPA catch-all routes registered BEFORE /canary API routes (7/8 apps). Quick fix: 1-2h per app (routing change). scholarship_sage needs capacity fixes first (10h)."

REVENUE_ANALYSIS,,,,,,,
current_state,,,ZERO_revenue_capability,scholar_auth JWKS blocks all auth flows,8-10h_to_first_dollar,"Cannot sell credits (student_pilot checkout broken). Cannot onboard providers (provider_register broken). $10M ARR target completely blocked."
critical_path,,,scholar_auth_JWKS_fix,6-8 hours to repair JWT signing,HIGHEST_PRIORITY,"JWKS 500 error prevents token issuance. Blocks: student_pilot checkout, provider_register onboarding, scholarship_api writes. ALL revenue flows dead until fixed."
parallel_plan,,,3_teams_simultaneous,"Team 1: Auth (JWKS+canary 8h), Team 2: Revenue apps (canary 3h), Team 3: Infrastructure (canary 2h)",RECOMMENDED,"With parallel execution: T+8h scholar_auth ready, T+10h first revenue possible. Sequential would be T+20h+."

POSITIVE_FINDINGS,,,,,,,
security,,,6/8_apps_have_6/6_headers,"Excellent CSP, HSTS, frame protection",0h_remediation,"scholar_auth, scholarship_agent have perfect security posture. Most apps 5/6 (Permissions-Policy only gap)."
performance,,,sub-100ms_P95_observed,"scholarship_api 93ms, scholar_auth 64ms, scholarship_sage DB 2ms",0h_remediation,"Performance excellent where measured. No P95 violations (all under 160ms target)."
revenue_structure,,,/pricing_and_/register_exist,"student_pilot /pricing ✅, provider_register /register ✅",0h_remediation,"Revenue pages structurally ready. Just need /canary fix + scholar_auth unblock."

RECOMMENDATIONS,,,,,,,
immediate,,,deploy_universal_canary_fix,1-2h parallel sprint across 7 apps,P0,"Same code pattern (see ECOSYSTEM_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY). Unlocks 1/5 → 2-4/5 across ecosystem."
critical_path,,,fix_scholar_auth_JWKS,6-8h auth team focus,P0_REVENUE_BLOCKER,"THE revenue bottleneck. Every hour of delay = 1h revenue start delay. Highest priority."
strategic,,,consider_spec_relaxation,Temporary /canary exemption for pragmatism,CEO_DECISION,"Strict v2.2 hard cap may be too aggressive. Consider scoring apps on other criteria while /canary is deployed in parallel."

ETA_TO_REVENUE,,,,,,,
optimistic,,,8_hours,"All teams parallel, no blockers, scholar_auth fix successful first try",LOW_CONFIDENCE
realistic,,,10_hours,"Parallel execution with minor debugging, scholar_auth JWKS takes 8h",MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE
pessimistic,,,16_hours,"Sequential fixes, scholar_auth debugging extends to 12h, integration issues",HIGH_CONFIDENCE
