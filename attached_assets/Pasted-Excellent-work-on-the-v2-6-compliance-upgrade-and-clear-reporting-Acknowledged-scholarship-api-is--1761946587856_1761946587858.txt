Excellent work on the v2.6 compliance upgrade and clear reporting. Acknowledged: scholarship_api is production-ready with degraded-mode expected until scholar_auth A1 clears.

Decision
Proceed with the Agent3 “QA Automation Lead (Read-Only) E2E System Validation” as a new task. Treat the attached spec as executable, not just reference. Run it first in staging, then a limited read-only canary in production using synthetic accounts.

Rationale

We need a full, independent system test across all 8 apps before broad rollout, aligned with best practice for system-level validation and risk reduction .
The test must prioritize our core B2C activation path—driving the first document upload—since it is the strongest predictor of engagement and downstream monetization .
Use private (gated) deployments for staging to control access and keep the environment secure while tests run .
Validate resilience and degraded-mode fallbacks during auth/service interruptions to prevent cascading failures .
Maintain Responsible AI guardrails, human-on-the-loop approval gates, and audit trails throughout the validation .
Scope and Priorities for Agent3 E2E (read-only)

B2C funnel
SEO/landing -> signup -> Magic Onboarding -> first document upload (activation) -> predictive matching -> Essay Coach credit purchase flow -> application submission checkpoints .
B2B/provider funnel
Provider onboarding -> listing management -> student traffic handoff -> 3% platform fee checks -> analytics views.
Platform services
scholar_auth A1 gating behaviors; verify degraded-mode UX is acceptable and safe.
Resiliency: retries, circuit breakers, and fallbacks observable during induced dependency timeouts or failures .
Staging access controls via private deployments to keep tests contained .
Responsible AI
Ensure Essay Coach and workflows do not facilitate academic dishonesty, and log XAI/decision traces for auditability and explainability .
Success Criteria (exit gates)

Critical-path E2E pass rate: 100% across the flows above.
Performance: APIs meet our SLO envelope under normal load; verify P95 response times and error rates via deployment analytics where available .
Security: No P0/P1 vulnerabilities; auth and data access respect least privilege; staging isolated via private deployments .
Resilience: Verified degraded-mode UX; no cascading failures under induced faults; fallbacks work as designed .
Responsible AI: HOTL controls in place; action logs and audit trails complete .
Deliverables

E2E Test Report: coverage, pass/fail, defect log, traces, and evidence.
Performance and Security Summaries: latency/error distributions, auth/permissions checks, vulnerability scan results.
Risk Register + Go/No-Go recommendation.
Jira tickets for all defects/regressions.
Operating Constraints and Timeline

Environments: Staging first (private deployment), then a 5% production canary (read-only, synthetic accounts), with clear rollback rules.
Data: Synthetic, non-PII test data only.
Target: Initial staging report within 48 hours of kickoff; canary run immediately after a green staging exit.
Next step
Confirm “GO” and name the staging environment/endpoints you want Agent3 to target. If different, share any overrides to the attached Agent3 prompt. Once confirmed, I’ll treat this as approved and you can begin execution.
