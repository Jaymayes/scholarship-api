Excellent work. Deployment is clean, gates are green, and the soak plan is appropriately rigorous.

Executive decision

Proceed with the 72-hour soak as planned.
Pre-authorize production rollout at T+72h contingent on passing the measurable gates below. Default is GO unless a red gate triggers.
Go/No-Go criteria (must all be met during Day 1 and Day 2 peak/chaos windows)
Reliability and performance

Availability per service ≥99.9%; error rate ≤0.5% overall and ≤1% during chaos windows.
Latency: P95 ≤120ms, P99 ≤250ms at 100 RPS and during spike tests.
Error budget burn: <25% per day, <50% cumulative over the soak.
Autoscaling: no thrash; cold-start P95 ≤200ms; scale-out reacts in ≤60s under 2x load step.
Security and compliance

SAST/DAST: 0 critical/high; SBOM delta introduces 0 criticals; dependency scan pass.
Egress allowlist intact (no bypasses); RBAC tests pass; audit logs immutable (write-once verified).
PII redaction: 0 leaks; DSR flow e2e validated with audit trail.
Data integrity and resilience

Backup/restore drill: RTO ≤15 minutes, RPO ≤5 minutes with data checksums passing.
Chaos tests: graceful degradation works; MTTR for induced incidents ≤10 minutes; all alerts fired and were actionable.
Database and TLS hardening

TLS verify-full enforced; handshake failure rate <0.1% of connections; cert rotation runbook exercised.
DB: P95 query latency <30ms; P99 <100ms; connection pool saturation <80%; deadlocks ≤1/hour; replica lag P95 <100ms.
Business protection (must hold to protect growth engines)

SEO: crawl success ≥99%, sitemaps and robots.txt validated, Core Web Vitals unchanged (LCP, INP, CLS within prior baselines).
Auto Page Maker: 95th percentile build <3s; publish queue <5 minutes; no indexation regressions in staging test harness.
Provider API: health ≥99.5%; timeout rate <0.2%; webhook success ≥99%; 0 auth scope regressions.
Observability

100% telemetry ingestion for logs/metrics/traces; no cardinality explosions; redaction filters verified in traces.
Runbooks linked to every page; on-call drill completed with ≤5 minutes acknowledgement.
Day-by-day directives
Day 0 (active now)

Capture baseline by service and endpoint, including saturation (CPU <70% P95, memory headroom >20%, GC pause P99 <50ms), DB metrics above, and cache hit ratios.
Day 1 (100 RPS + scale)

Perform step load: 50→100→150 RPS in 5-minute increments. Record scale decisions, cold starts, and cost per 1k requests.
Spike test: 3x in ≤5 minutes to simulate launch surge; verify rate limiting, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.
Validate CDN/WAF interplay with Host Validation and 4xx preservation; ensure no 4xx are rewritten to 5xx at the edge.
Day 2 (chaos + recovery)

Fail DB primary with controlled switchover; verify zero data loss within RPO; MTTR ≤10 minutes.
Induce provider API outage; confirm retries, backoff, and user messaging; no queue dead-letter growth beyond thresholds.
Network partition and DNS failover test; validate egress policy enforcement and deny logs.
Execute full backup/restore drill with checksums and event replay.
Day 3 (decision window)

10:00 local: deliver executive packet and recommendation with scorecard against the Go/No-Go criteria and a diff from Day 0.
18:00 UTC: If green, begin production canary.
Production rollout plan (pre-authorized)

Freeze window: no non-critical changes during canary.
Canary: 10% traffic for 30 minutes → 50% for 30 minutes → 100%. Rollback if any SLO breached for two consecutive 5-minute windows or any red gate triggers.
Rollback: blue/green or canary disable in ≤5 minutes; data migration reversibility documented.
Comms: stakeholder notice T-2 hours; status updates at each canary step; post-mortem if rollback.
Business and finance instrumentation

Report unit economics from Day 1: cost per 1k requests by service, projected infra cost at 5x and 10x Day 1 load. Confirm margins remain ≥4x markup on AI services under peak.
Validate no impact to SEO engine throughput and provider API revenue protection. Include: simulated indexation rate, crawl depth coverage, provider webhook latency distribution.
Open asks for the daily 10:00 report

SLO scorecard by service, error budget burn-down, and top-3 regressions with owners.
Security delta: SBOM diff, dependency updates, DAST endpoint coverage %, and any medium findings with risk notes.
Data integrity: backup/restore timings and checksum results; DSR test artifacts.
Business protection: SEO crawl metrics, Auto Page Maker build/publish times, provider API timeout/error distributions.
Cost: infra $/1k requests and projected monthly at current and 5x load.
Risks to watch

TLS handshake spikes after verify-full under load.
Autoscaling thrash leading to tail latency degradation.
CDN/WAF header normalization breaking Host Validation.
Provider rate limits during chaos tests causing cascading retries.
Decision policy

If all gates above are green at T+72h, proceed to production without additional executive meeting.
If any red gate triggers, page me immediately and hold for executive review.
Thank you—keep the dashboards live and page on any red gate.
