Approved. Release the next 30-day capital allocation and proceed with execution. Your Phase 1 and monetization go-live meet or exceed our targets and align with the “almost no effort” concierge vision, hybrid monetization (credits + B2B), SEO-first growth, and enterprise-grade reliability/security mandates in the Playbook     .

30-day OKRs (acceptance criteria)

Acquisition and SEO (low-CAC engine)
Ship ≥200 programmatic scholarship pages + 5 pillar guides (FAFSA, essays, deadlines, financial literacy). Track index coverage ≥80%, CTR ≥2%, and deliver ≥25k MAUs with ≥50% from organic channels by day 30 .
Student value and automation
Maintain sub-5-minute time-to-first-5-matches; median “concierge loop” near your 6-second demo benchmark.
Raise pre-fill coverage to ≥95% across two standardized application portals; include read-only preview, field-level confidence, and error handling .
Monetization (credit model)
Keep transparent token pricing with 4x markup and starter credits; target ≥8% 7‑day credit attach rate for new cohorts; report ARPPU and gross margin on AI usage .
Marketplace (B2B pilot)
Onboard 10–15 pilot partners via self-serve portal (e‑sign, automated verification, listing creation, basic analytics). Publish ≥100 live listings and secure 3 case studies/quotes .
Data ingestion and ranking quality
Expand ingestion/normalization for eligibility, materials, deadlines, essay themes to support ranking at scale; publish a feature dictionary and schema docs for the matching engine .
Reliability, security, and trust
Operate at ≥99.9% uptime and P95 latency ≤120ms; demonstrate autoscaling + multi‑AZ failover tests; keep WAF, strict input validation/allow lists/path normalization/least privilege active; show passing directory traversal tests and weekly vuln scans .
Responsible AI and transparency
Keep Essay Coach in “assistant, not ghostwriter” mode with visible disclosures and “why matched” explanations for rankings; position win-likelihood as a probability estimate, not a guarantee, with confidence cues .
Capital allocation guidance (30 days)

40% Product/Engineering: application automation to ≥95% pre-fill, ingestion/normalization scale, dashboard UX polish.
30% SEO/Content/Auto Page Maker: programmatic build-out, pillar guides, internal linking, sitemaps.
20% Partnerships: pilot onboarding, training resources, analytics instrumentation, case studies.

Two short demos next week (keep concise)

Auto Page Maker at scale: generate, index, and report on 50+ programmatic pages with live search impressions and early CTR; show the content templates and internal linking plan to support organic capture .
Partner portal onboarding: live self-serve signup → e‑sign → verification → first listing → basic analytics view; include the resources library and support tiers for the flywheel .
Weekly CEO dashboard (send every Monday)

Student engine: MAUs (organic%), onboarding completion, time-to-first-match, match CTR, application starts/submissions, Essay Coach usage.
Monetization: credit attach rate (7/14/30‑day), ARPPU, cost-to-serve, margin (vs 4x markup) .

Risks to monitor

SEO indexation lag: mitigate with sitemaps, internal links, and consistent publishing cadence .
Calibration drift: track Brier score and reliability week-over-week; retrain if drift >5% from last calibrated cohort .
Partner activation friction: iterate portal UX and resources library; maintain tiered support for pilots to fuel the flywheel .
Decision

Proceed with the next-phase deliverables immediately. Capital tranche released, subject to weekly KPI reviews and the two demos above. If you prefer, I can review a specific area in depth; otherwise, execute to the OKRs and send the first weekly dashboard and demo links.
