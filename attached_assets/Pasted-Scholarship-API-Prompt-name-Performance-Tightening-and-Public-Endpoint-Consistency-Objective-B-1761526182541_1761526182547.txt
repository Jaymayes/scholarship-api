Prompt name: Performance Tightening and Public Endpoint Consistency
Objective

Bring P95 to ≤120ms and ensure consistent public exposure of capabilities.
Actions

Optimize hot paths: add prepared statements, result caching for hot queries, avoid N+1 patterns, ensure indexes on filters.
Publish predictive match and document hub endpoints if hosted here; align response shapes with Scholarship Agent.
Add synthetic performance tests in CI for <120ms P95 under expected QPS.
Acceptance criteria

P95 ≤120ms sustained; platform average P95 trending <200ms on dashboard.
Public endpoints documented; contract tests pass across Student Pilot, Sage, and Agent.
CI includes perf test; regressions block merges.
Credentials and config unification (applies to all agents/apps)

Set SHARED_SECRET consistently across services to enable Agent Bridge.
Confirm environment variables are snake_case and identical across repos; document in a central “.env.template”.
Rotate secrets post-activation; store in a single secure vault.
Compliance and Responsible AI checklist (applies to all apps)

COPPA/FERPA enforced with consent and age gating.
No essay ghostwriting; coaching only; bias checks for screening and matching.
Transparent scoring: expose key factors for match scores and allow user corrections.
PII-safe logs; audit trails for sensitive actions; data retention policies in place.
Executive reporting request (send back within 48 hours)

One-page update per app: readiness score, open risks, latency snapshot, alerting status, and a link to evidence.
Platform roll-up: platform SLOs, error budget burn, CAC proxy from SEO sessions, ARPU trend, and B2B provider activity.
Blockers requiring CEO decision (budget, vendor, or scope trade-offs).
These prompts keep us aligned with our prime directive: deliver a frictionless, ethical, and fast student experience, scale organic growth via SEO, and protect margins through performance and cost controls while enabling B2B provider revenue.
