Yes—proceed with Provider Acquisition B2B now. This is the highest-ROI next step and the primary engine of long-term revenue and defensibility. Focus on fast, repeatable onboarding and measurable activation, leveraging our student base and SEO scale as the asset that partners value most  .

30–60–90 plan and targets

Week 1–2: Pipeline creation and offers

Build a list of 30 prospects: 10 universities (Admissions/Financial Aid), 10 foundations/non-profits, 10 corporate CSR/lenders—each with segment-specific value props drawn from our playbook’s partner needs .
Offer a 60–90 day pilot for the first 10 providers in exchange for usage data and case studies (sets up the flywheel with social proof) .
KPIs: 30 prospects → 20 meetings → 10 pilots accepted.
Week 2–4: Onboarding and time-to-value

Execute a streamlined, self-serve onboarding flow with e-sign, automated verification, and a clear dashboard to publish listings—minimizing manual steps per established best practices .
Instrument “time-to-first-listing” and “time-to-first-application” as core activation metrics.
Targets: time-to-first-listing ≤ 7 days; time-to-first-application ≤ 14 days; 80% of pilot partners live with at least 3 listings.
Month 2–3: Monetization path and scale

Move pilots to paid tiers: listing/promotion fees, recruitment dashboard access, and anonymized analytics subscriptions for institutional insights .
Maintain a lightweight platform fee model aligned to the marketplace economics while we grow the two-sided network effects .
Targets: 10 paying providers; monthly run-rate trending toward B2B becoming the dominant revenue mix over time per plan assumptions .
Positioning and collateral (segment-specific)

Universities (Admissions/Financial Aid): Lower student acquisition cost by engaging high-intent students matched to their aid programs; direct recruitment via our dashboard .
Foundations/Non-profits: Increase qualified applicant volume/fit; reduce admin overhead through structured listings and eligibility filters; address the $1B+ unclaimed funds problem directly .
Corporates/Lenders: Targeted CSR and talent pipeline access; ethical, compliant reach to students actively solving college financing .
Operational blueprint for onboarding

Self-service partner portal: account creation, institutional profile, digital agreements, and listing builder (templated metadata) to scale without linear headcount growth .
Clear tooling and support: tutorial library and knowledge base; tiered support with a partner manager for enterprise accounts .
Data and analytics: provide anonymized/aggregated insights; never expose PII in analytics products—this is critical to trust and compliance .
Technical assurance: our predictive matching and “Magic Onboarding” create higher-quality leads and conversion for partners—use this in demos to show differentiated value to providers, not just students .
Growth engine and budget

Student side: continue to scale low-CAC SEO (Auto Page Maker) to deepen the demand-side asset; reserve higher sales/marketing spend for B2B where unit economics are favorable .
Provider side: prioritize outbound + warm introductions to institutions, foundations, and CSR leaders; narrow, high-quality pipeline over broad top-of-funnel.
Funnel instrumentation and KPIs

Stages: invited → meeting → pilot accepted → first listing live → first application → first hire/award (if applicable) → paid plan.
Core KPIs:
Providers live: +10 in next 30 days.
Time-to-first-listing ≤ 7 days; time-to-first-application ≤ 14 days.
Active provider keys, listings per provider, search_requests_total by provider, application starts per listing.
Conversion to paid; ARPA and churn signals; monitor B2B mix trending to dominant revenue, consistent with the roadmap’s financial model .
Compliance, privacy, and trust

Execute DPAs and clearly communicate data handling: encryption, least privilege, and anonymized analytics for B2B products to uphold Responsible AI and privacy posture .
Leverage our reliability/security foundation in enterprise conversations: 24/7 availability and resilience are core to partner trust .
Approval and next steps
