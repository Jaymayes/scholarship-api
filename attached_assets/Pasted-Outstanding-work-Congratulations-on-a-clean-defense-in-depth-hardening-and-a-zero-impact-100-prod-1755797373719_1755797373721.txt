Outstanding work. Congratulations on a clean, defense-in-depth hardening and a zero-impact 100% production rollout.

Immediate next steps (next 24–48 hours)

Maintain heightened monitoring:
SLIs: availability ≥99.9%, p95 ≤220 ms, 5xx ≤0.5%.
Security: waf_sqli_block_count, auth_failures_total, jwt_replay_prevented_total, cors_denied_origin_count, response_stack_traces_count should remain within normal bands; page on any spike.
Synthetics from 3 regions: auth OK (200), unauth (401), disallowed-origin preflight (403/no CORS), SQLi probe (403 at WAF).
Confirm the one pending control (you reported 8/9 operational):
Which control remains? Provide current mitigation and ETA to full compliance.
If it’s optional, document risk acceptance; otherwise, assign owner/duedate.
Post-incident closeout (within 3–5 business days)

Run a blameless RCA and publish:
Timeline, indicators, scope/impact (confirmed none or detail if any), root causes (e.g., PUBLIC_READ_ENDPOINTS, missing WAF), corrective actions completed, and preventative controls.
Evidence pack:
Attach WAF and app logs showing PoCs blocked (401/403), DB logs proving parameterized queries (bound params), key/credential rotation records (old kid/user revoked), and SLI snapshots.
Update runbooks and guardrails:
JWT rotation, Redis/WAF failover, incident response, rate limiting policies, and change/rollback procedures.
Guardrails to prevent recurrence (institutionalize)

Policy as code
Admission/GitOps policies (OPA/Kyverno) to block prod deploys if:
PUBLIC_READ_ENDPOINTS=true or DEBUG=true
CORS allowlist contains wildcard or dev origins
Ingress exposes debug/docs without auth (if your policy requires)
CI/CD security gates
SAST (bandit), dependency scan (pip-audit), secret scan, SBOM.
Pre-prod DAST with your PoCs (JWT alg=none, invalid claims, CORS, SQLi).
Security unit/integration tests: JWT alg pinning + iss/aud/exp/nbf/jti, route-level auth guards, strict CORS, parameterized SQL, rate limiting and Replay protection.
Config drift detection
Monitor and alert on security-critical env/config deltas (auth flags, CORS allowlist, JWKS issuer, WAF mode).
Keys and credentials
Document rotation cadence (e.g., quarterly); verify JWKS cache TTL and rollover path in staging monthly.
Operational hygiene and compliance

Data review: finalize forensics conclusion (no PII exfil found) or execute breach workflow if evidence indicates otherwise.
Logging and retention: ensure audit logs are PII-redacted and retained per policy; correlation IDs everywhere.
Records and DPIA: update data-flow diagrams and risk register if applicable (GDPR/CCPA).
Monitoring thresholds (keep in place)

WAF block count: alert only if correlated with app 5xx or sudden spikes.
auth_failures_total: alert on 3× baseline for 10 min.
jwt_replay_prevented_total: anomaly detection; investigate spikes.
response_stack_traces_count: any >0 → page.
Redis limiter errors: any >0 for 5 min → page.
SLO burn alerts: fast burn ≥2%/hour (30–60 min) page; slow burn ≥1%/6h ticket.
Next 7-day action plan

Day 1–2: Maintain heightened monitoring; run a short chaos drill (pod kill + brief Redis/WAF failover) to reconfirm behavior post-hardening.
Day 3: Complete RCA and publish with evidence; finalize runbook updates.
Day 4–5: Implement/verify admission policies and CI/CD security gates; add the PoCs to pre-prod pipeline.
Day 6–7: Review alert noise and tune; schedule quarterly key/credential rotation and monthly chaos drills.
Optional high-ROI backlog

Per-tenant quotas/rate limits; idempotency keys for any write paths.
Pagination defaults/max and ETag/Cache-Control for list endpoints.
Full recommendations feature behind a flag with caching/precompute.
Consumer contract tests generated from OpenAPI.
Please confirm which control is the one not yet fully operational and its ETA. If you want, share your WAF platform (NGINX/Kong/AWS/GCP), the final hotfix image tag, and your alert names; I’ll produce a one-page Go-Live Verification Summary for your change record with direct pass/fail checks and evidence links.
