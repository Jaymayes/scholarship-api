Phenomenal work. With Priority 2 Day 2 complete and the reconciliation fix in place, I’m authorizing the production launch program with a controlled ramp and strict SLO gates. Here’s the plan to reach 100% readiness and translate this into business impact.

Decision

Proceed to Priority 3 (Resilience, deploy safety, data protection) and initiate the Go-Live Ramp with SLO guardrails.
Keep custom debug routes as a P2 track; not blocking.
Go-Live Ramp (72 hours)

Pre-launch freeze (today):
Lock the OpenAPI spec and contract tests; tag release v1.0.0.
Confirm dashboards, burn-rate alerts, and runbooks are linked in the on-call rotation.
Owner: Platform Eng. Acceptance: green CI, signed release notes, on-call confirmed.
Canary → 10% → 50% → 100%:
Start at 10% traffic for 6 hours. Promote if: p95 ≤ 120 ms, 5xx < 0.1%, error budget burn < 1% in window.
Escalate to 50% for 12 hours with same gates. Then to 100% for general availability.
Owner: DevOps. Evidence: Grafana panels and alert history captured per step.
Priority 3 (5-day window)

Resilience and deploy safety
Health probes and graceful shutdown: prove zero in-flight loss during rolling restart. Acceptance: no 5xx during a rolling update; verified with synthetic checks.
Automated rollback: wire SLO-breach rollback on canary. Acceptance: one forced rollback demo with evidence.
Zero-downtime migrations: dry run in staging; document shadow reads/writes if needed. Acceptance: migration playbook approved.
Data protection and recovery
Backups/restore: perform a restore to staging; document RPO/RTO and integrity checks. Acceptance: successful restore report with timestamps and row counts.
Secrets posture: re-validate no secrets in code/logs; rotate keys post-launch. Acceptance: rotation evidence and checks pass.
Compliance and privacy
Final privacy posture: verify no PII leakage in logs; confirm privacy policy and data-use disclosures match actual data flows. Acceptance: compliance checklist signed.
Business readiness and growth instrumentation (in parallel; 1-week window)

Developer experience and growth
Ship minimal SDKs/examples (curl, JS/TS, Python) for search, pagination, filtering; include error schema examples. Acceptance: examples pass against contract tests.
Developer portal: quick-start, rate limits, correlation-id guidance, and breaking-change policy.
KPI instrumentation for revenue and adoption
Add business telemetry: search_requests_total, search_results_count, provider_keys_active, daily_active_consumer_keys.
Build a “Business Ops” dashboard: daily active providers, student searches, application starts/submits, error rate by customer, and latency by tier.
Acceptance: dashboard reviewed weekly; alerts on adoption regressions.
SLO to KPI linkage
Create a simple model relating SLO breaches to projected churn and CAC waste; alert on “business-risk” thresholds, not just technical ones.
P2 workstream: custom internal routes

Time-boxed isolation (48 hours, not blocking):
A/B deploy to an alternate host to determine if 404s are platform-specific.
Log route table and root_path on startup; compare proxy headers and path stripping behavior.
Exit: either route works on at least one environment or documented platform limitation with workaround (keep unified /metrics).
Launch readiness checklist (final Go)

All SLO gates green through 10% → 50% → 100% ramp.
Rollback tested and documented.
Backup/restore drill passed; secrets rotation completed.
Contract tests and performance gates enforced in CI on the release branch.
Business dashboard live; weekly review cadence booked.
Reporting cadence

Twice-daily status during ramp: SLOs, error budget, notable alerts, any mitigations.
Post-GA (Day 7): launch retrospective with action items and updates to runbooks.
This path protects reliability and security while converting our engineering wins into measurable business outcomes. Proceed with the canary and Priority 3 tasks now; alert me immediately if any gate is missed or if error budget burn exceeds projections.
