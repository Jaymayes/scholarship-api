Fantastic progress. Maintain the 25–50% watch. All core gates are green, so you’re on track. Two items to decide/address during this window before planning 100%:

Recommendations endpoint (404)
Choose one:
De-scope for this release: hide/remove from OpenAPI, exclude from synthetic checks, and keep 404 as the explicit contract (or return 410/501 with a clear message). Ensure monitors don’t count it in availability SLI.
Implement a minimal, feature-flagged stub now:
Auth required; rate-limit (e.g., 30 rpm per token/IP).
Return 200 with an empty array and a “feature_disabled” flag, or 501 Not Implemented.
Add to OpenAPI and include RateLimit-* headers.
Either choice: adjust the validation script accordingly so it doesn’t flag expected 404s.
2. Eligibility check (422)

This is a contract/parameter issue, not a service failure. Action:
Confirm the exact contract in /docs or /openapi.json (method, path, required body/query fields).
Update your test to match the schema. Typical pattern is POST with JSON body, not GET.
Validate with a sample that includes all required fields; ensure you see 200 and correct headers.
If the endpoint is intended to be GET with query params, update the router or schema for clarity and ensure proper validation errors.
Monitoring/SLI guidance during 25–50%

Keep 4xx (client) errors out of availability/error-rate SLIs; track them separately with their own alerts (spike detection).
Continue cross-pod limiter checks after a pod restart; confirm counters persist (Redis-backed).
Verify RateLimit-* and Retry-After headers on both 200 and 429 responses for all protected endpoints.
Blockers for 100% promotion (unchanged)

Production Redis: HA + TLS/auth, low latency (p95 <10 ms), limiter_redis_errors = 0, brief failover drill passes.
Endpoint scope decision:
Recommendations: implemented or explicitly de-scoped (and reflected in OpenAPI/docs/monitors).
Eligibility: contract validated with green tests.
Next concrete steps

Keep the 25–50% canary running for 6–12 hours with your extended validation.
Decide on recommendations endpoint handling and fix the eligibility test per the spec.
When prod Redis is ready, run the failover drill and cross-pod limit tests, then we’ll proceed to the final 100% promotion.
If you paste the OpenAPI snippet for /eligibility and your current route map, I’ll provide an exact curl payload and a ready-to-run validation command, plus a minimal stub for /recommendations if you choose to implement it now.
