Yes—let’s validate Week 2 with a fast, structured test pass. Please run the three focused demos below and share the artifacts; then proceed directly into Week 3 execution.

What to demo and what to capture

SEO Auto Page Maker (goal: 120+ pages live, ≥90% quality, accelerating organic MAU)
Live walk-through: 5 representative programmatic pages showing internal linking hubs, schema.org (Scholarship, FAQ, Breadcrumb), canonical tags, and CWV/Lighthouse.
Evidence:
Sitemap URL + list of 25 priority URLs.
Index coverage, impressions, CTR: export last 7 days (Search Console) and page-level CTR for 10 URLs.
Internal link map (screenshot or graph) demonstrating hubs to priority pages.
Quality check: sample template inputs/outputs and duplicate-content safeguards.
Targets this week: ≥60% indexation, CTR ≥2%, ≥12k MAUs with ≥50% from organic.
2. Partner Portal time-to-value (goal: ≤5 minutes to first listing, 10–15 pilots, ≥50 live listings)

Live flow: signup → e-sign → verification → first listing → analytics view in ≤5 minutes.
Evidence:
Time breakdown per step and drop-off funnel.
Pilot roster (name, segment) and listings count.
3 partner quotes/case studies (even brief) on clarity and speed.
Targets this week: complete roster at 10–15 pilots, ≥50 listings live.
3. Application Automation + Responsible AI (goal: ≥95% pre-fill with transparent assistant behavior)

Live flow: two standardized application portals.
Evidence:
Pre-fill coverage report by field + confidence scores; show read-only preview and error handling.
Logs for fallback to manual fields and rate of successful submit-ready forms.
Essay Coach disclosures visible, “assistant, not ghostwriter” behavior validated.
Targets this week: maintain ≥95% coverage; submit-ready rate ≥85% of attempts.
Technical and trust checks (share alongside demos)

API performance: /api/v1/week2/* latency distribution (P50/P95), error rate, and rate-limit headers in responses; error budget burn for the week.
Security: WAF blocks (top rules), directory-traversal test cases (pass/fail), input validation unit tests, least-privilege service account summary.
Reliability: autoscaling and Multi-AZ failover test evidence (timestamp, duration, zero customer-impact verification).
Accessibility: Lighthouse/axe scores for student flow and partner portal (aim AA).
Data privacy: data retention policy highlights and audit log sample (PII access).
Monetization snapshot (week-over-week)

Credit attach rate (7/14-day cohorts), ARPPU, cost-to-serve vs 4x markup, top AI features by credit spend. Highlight any friction points in purchase flow.
Next steps after demos (no delay)

If SEO indexation lags: push XML sitemaps daily, strengthen internal links, expand FAQs, and prune thin/near-duplicate pages.
If portal TTV stalls above 5 minutes: pre-fill org data from verification response, defer non-critical fields, add in-product tooltips and a 90-second “first listing” guide.
If pre-fill <95% on certain portals: add field-level heuristics and confidence thresholds; expand mapping tables and escalate provider-specific patterns.
Send me:

Demo links (or recordings), exports, and the weekly CEO dashboard.
A Postman collection for /api/v1/week2/.
A one-page risk/mitigation update.
Once received, I’ll review the artifacts same day and, if targets are tracking, approve the next tranche for content scale (toward 300+ pages), partner activation (toward 100 listings), and ingestion expansion. Proceed.
