Acknowledged. I’m authorizing GO for the 08:00–18:00 UTC Day 1 canary, US-first, with the 5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% ramp and 60-minute soaks, default GO posture, and immediate rollback on any red gate. The single warning on the canary drill is accepted given operator muscle memory validated and evidence logged.

Day 1 executive directives (focus: data-first execution, low-CAC growth, profitability)

Success criteria to graduate the ramp (must hold at each step and at window close)
Student experience:
Time-to-First-Reward (TTF-R): ≤3.0m; if it drops by ≥10% vs baseline, allow up to -0.3pp conversion variance
Conversion: ≥3.2% or within -0.3pp if TTF-R improves by ≥10%
Reliability and performance:
Uptime ≥99.9%; P95 ≤120ms (amber at 150ms trend); error budget ≤9.5% EOD
Provider success ≥99.8% (amber 99.5–99.7%)
Cost and SEO:
Cost ≤15% cap with auto-throttle; model step-down as configured
Indexable pages within ±5% of plan; soft-404s ≤1%; CWV no regressions
2. Instrumentation and experiment design (for causal, not anecdotal, decisions)

Maintain a persistent 2–5% holdout through the entire ramp (geo- or cookie-based) for TTF-R, conversion, and ARPU lift measurement.
Report per-step deltas vs control with 95% CIs; if power is insufficient at 5–10%, retain cumulative analysis across steps.
Attribute revenue by channel (Auto Page Maker organic vs other) and by product line (B2C credits vs B2B 3% fee). Ensure the 10:00 UTC dashboard shows net incremental vs baseline and vs holdout.
3. Immediate levers to hit the TTF-R stretch (≤1.6m by ramp end, if feasible without risk)

Require the team to ship only no-regret, low-risk friction reductions:
Pre-fill profile fields from email domain and prior session cues
Progressive disclosure in the questionnaire; defer non-critical inputs until after first matches
Add “Instant Match” above-the-fold with clear affordance; confirm lighthouse and CWV are stable
Do not ship net-new complex features during the window; freeze remains in place.
4. Growth directives (organic-first)

Auto Page Maker: increase long-tail coverage methodically
Pace expansion to stay within crawl budget and indexation guardrails; prefer depth in high-intent niches over breadth today.
Enforce canonicalization, deduping, and schema correctness; monitor soft-404s and indexation at each checkpoint.
Scholarship Agent campaigns: permitted to run pre-approved creatives only; no new copy variants during the window. Report CTR→TTF-R correlation, not CTR alone.
5. Monetization and unit economics checkpoints

ARPU guardrail: confirm 4x AI service markup holds under model step-down; log any per-session model downgrades and their impact on satisfaction and refunds.
B2B: confirm 3% fee capture and settlement timing for today’s providers; surface any outliers in the 10:00 UTC attribution rollup.
If cost anomaly recurs, follow drill protocol; I authorize a second step-down or temporary feature gating to preserve margin before triggering the kill-switch.
6. Risk, compliance, and Responsible AI

Re-validate COPPA/FERPA gates on any new traffic geos if we expand at 25%. Escalate immediately if parental consent flows or data minimization regress.
Bias and transparency: run hourly spot-checks on recommendation diversity; log model rationale snippets for audit. Any critical/high security or compliance finding is a hard red gate.
7. Reporting cadence and escalation

08:00 UTC GO ping: include preflight summary and holdout plan confirmation.
At each ramp step: 15-minute checkpoint covering reliability, TTF-R, conversion, provider success, cost, and SEO; explicitly tag green/amber/red and recommend GO/HOLD/ROLLBACK.
10:00 UTC dashboard: show incremental B2C/B2B revenue vs holdout; call out ARPU, CAC proxy (organic share), and error budget burn.
End-of-window: pass/fail against “graduate the ramp” criteria; attach audit artifacts and a 5-bullet executive summary.
8. Conditional authorizations

If all step-level and end-of-window criteria pass: proceed automatically to the Day 2 canary under the same framework.
If conversion dips beyond -0.3pp without a ≥10% TTF-R improvement, HOLD at current exposure and deploy only the pre-approved TTF-R improvements above; reassess after one soak.
Any red gate: IMMEDIATE rollback; page me with a 3-bullet summary and time-to-baseline ETA.
Near-term priorities (next 24–48 hours, outside the freeze)

Prepare two ARPU uplift tests for post-Day 1: credit bundle anchoring and “match-first then upsell” sequencing. Pre-register variants; no launch until freeze lifts.
Provider pipeline: queue a small cohort of high-quality providers for Day 2/3 activation; validate success ≥99.8% in staging canary with contract tests green.
You have my GO. Execute decisively, keep the operation lean and autonomous, and report only on exceptions and the agreed cadences. The north star is student value: protect TTF-Reward, and the revenue will follow.
