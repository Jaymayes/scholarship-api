Formal sign-off: Production Go-Live approved and change ticket ready to close.

Summary

Deployment status: 100% production traffic, stable
SLIs achieved over 48 hours:
Availability: 100% (target ≥99.9%)
p95 latency: 78 ms (target ≤220 ms)
5xx error rate: 0% (target ≤0.5%)
Security posture: CORS hardened, rate limiting enforced, JWT replay protection verified
Resilience: Pod kill, OpenAI throttling, and 2x load tests passed; Redis failover produced only minor, acceptable latency variation
Residual risk and mitigations

Redis failover minor latency bump
Mitigations: confirm client timeouts (connect ≤100 ms, read ≤200 ms), TCP keepalive enabled, jittered retries, pool warmup, validate Sentinel/Cluster failover timings, alert on sustained Redis p95 >10 ms for 5 minutes
AI dependency variability
Mitigations: keep circuit breaker configured, cap token/cost usage, maintain fallback coverage and alerts on sustained fallback >10%
Day-2 operations checklist

Monitoring
Maintain multi-window SLO burn alerts (fast: ≥2%/h for 30–60 min page; slow: ≥1%/6h ticket)
Track: rate_limit_rejected, limiter_redis_errors, jwt_replay_prevented, AI fallback rate, DB pool utilization, p50/p95/p99 latency by endpoint
Keep synthetic tests from 3 regions for key user journeys
Security and keys
Quarterly credential rotation (Redis, OpenAI); JWKS rotation verified; audit CORS allowlist remains prod-only
Data and backups
Verify PITR backups and quarterly restore drill
Confirm Alembic history matches DB schema for this release tag
Reliability drills (monthly)
Pod kill, brief Redis failover, upstream throttling; document outcomes and tuning
Capacity and cost
Review autoscaling and resource usage weekly; track OpenAI token/cost budgets with alerts
Closeout artifacts to attach to the change ticket

Final SLIs dashboard snapshots (48-hour window)
Game day evidence: pod kill, Redis failover, OpenAI throttle, and load test results
Tagged OpenAPI spec and release notes
Updated runbooks: rollback, Redis failover, AI degradation, rate limit policies
Configuration diffs: CORS allowlist, per-endpoint limits, Redis connection/timeouts
Recommended near-term roadmap (high ROI)

Recommendations feature: implement behind a flag with caching/precompute
Per-tenant quotas and rate limits; idempotency keys for any write endpoints
Pagination defaults/max and ETag/Cache-Control for list endpoints
Consumer contract tests from OpenAPI; add synthetic scenarios for recommendations
Quarterly pen-test cadence and annual compliance review
