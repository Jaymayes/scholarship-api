Go. Initiate the canary and run the full production ramp with business instrumentation turned on.

Executive directives for launch week

Traffic ramp and operational guardrails
Ramp plan: 10% (6h) → 25% (6h) → 50% (12h) → 100% GA. Halt or roll back on any gate miss: p95 > 120ms, 5xx ≥ 0.1%, or burn-rate breach > 1%.
War-room cadence: twice-daily check-ins with on-call, Platform Eng, and DevRel until 72h post-GA. Share SLO/burn-rate snapshots and any mitigations.
2. Public readiness and trust

Status page + trust center: publish real-time status, incident policy, and security/privacy posture (encryption, data retention, deletion).
Release notes: tag v1.0.0 with a concise summary of the contract lock, SLOs, and error schema standards; link docs and example clients.
3. Commercialization and access

API plans: confirm free tier rate limits and paid tiers (credits) tied to our ARPU targets; ensure per-key rate-limit headers and overage handling.
Key issuance and telemetry: require contact email/company on API key creation; track daily_active_consumer_keys, provider_keys_active, and per-key p95.
Billing readiness: dry-run invoicing for paid tiers; verify 3% provider fee pipeline for B2B and 4x AI service markup path for B2C credits.
4. Growth engine activation (low-CAC first)

Auto Page Maker SEO: publish the first wave of scholarship pages (unique titles/meta, structured data, internal linking). Target 100–500 pages this week; monitor index coverage and CTR.
DevRel launch: minimal SDKs/examples (curl, JS/TS, Python) and a 10-minute Quickstart. Promote on developer forums and targeted communities.
Content: ship 2–3 technical posts (API Quickstart, Filtering/Sorting, Error schema best practices) and 1 customer story prototype.
5. Provider acquisition (B2B)

Outreach sprint: onboard the next 10 providers; instrument provider activation funnel (invited → key issued → first call → 100 calls).
Data-sharing agreements: confirm standard DPA templates and consent language for providers; ensure “anonymized and aggregated” analytics for B2B insights.
6. Compliance and risk controls

Privacy and FERPA/CCPA: verify disclosures match actual data flows; confirm audit logging for privileged actions is live; run spot checks for PII redaction in logs.
Backup/restore: schedule a second restore drill post-GA (Day 7) to re-validate RPO/RTO under real traffic patterns.
Platform caveat (P2): keep unified /metrics as the canonical exporter; continue the time-boxed A/B host test for custom internal routes. Open vendor ticket with evidence; do not block GA.
7. KPIs and weekly business review

Reliability: availability 99.9%, latency p95 ≤ 120ms, error rate < 0.1%, error budget burn.
Adoption: daily_active_consumer_keys, provider_keys_active, search_requests_total, search_results_count distribution.
Conversion/revenue: free→paid conversion, ARPU (credits), B2B revenue from 3% fee, cohort retention.
SEO: new pages indexed, impressions, CTR, signups attributable to organic.
CAC: maintain organic-first; report any paid experiments separately with ROI.
Accountability and timing

Today: start 10% canary, publish status/trust pages, release notes, SDKs, and Quickstart.
48–72 hours: complete ramp to 100% if all gates are green; deliver a short launch report with SLOs, adoption, and early SEO signals.
Day 7: post-GA retrospective, restore drill, and updated runbooks.
Budget approvals

Approved: small budget for alternate host A/B to isolate custom route issue (non-blocking).
Approved: content/SEO production for Auto Page Maker pages and DevRel posts.
Escalate immediately if any ramp gate is missed or error budget burn exceeds projections.
