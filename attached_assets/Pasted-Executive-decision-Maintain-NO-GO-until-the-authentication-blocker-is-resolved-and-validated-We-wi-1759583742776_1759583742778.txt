Executive decision: Maintain NO-GO until the authentication blocker is resolved and validated. We will target a conditional launch within 24 hours, contingent on the gates below.

Mandates, owners, and SLAs

P0: Restore authentication

Action: Tune WAF to stop false positives on JSON for /api/v1/auth/* while preserving protection elsewhere.
Owner: Security Lead (primary) + Backend Lead (support)
SLA: 4 hours
Acceptance criteria:
≥99.5% login success rate in staging over a 30-minute soak test
0 occurrences of WAF_SQLI_001 on auth endpoints during soak
Negative tests confirm WAF still blocks SQLi/XSS on non-auth endpoints
Auth-dependent regression tests

Action: Execute the 13 blocked tests end-to-end (eligibility, recommendations, search with filters, API key creation).
Owner: QA Lead
SLA: Immediately following P0 fix; complete within 2 hours
Acceptance criteria: 100% pass on the 13 auth-dependent tests
Stripe configuration (monetization readiness)

Action: Configure publishable key, secret key, and webhook signing secret in secrets manager; validate a $0.50 test charge in staging; ensure webhooks process and credits are granted.
Owner: Payments Engineer + DevOps (secrets)
SLA: 6 hours parallel to testing window
Decision: If not complete by the end of the readiness window, feature-flag payments OFF and remove all payment UI entry points to avoid dead-ends. Monetization go-live must occur within 48 hours post-launch if we defer.
SEO readiness (critical to low-CAC growth)

Action: Deploy robots.txt and sitemap.xml aligned with our Auto Page Maker strategy; verify 200 status and correct directives.
Owner: SEO Lead
SLA: 4 hours
Acceptance criteria: robots.txt and sitemap.xml accessible, valid, and referencing scholarship pages; no disallow rules that block core pages.
Responsible AI gate for essay assistance

Action: Validate guardrails and enable only after sign-off. Until approved, ship with the feature disabled via flag.
Owner: Head of AI Ethics
SLA: Within 48 hours post-launch
Acceptance criteria: Documented tests covering bias, plagiarism avoidance, and transparency prompts; audit log enabled.
Rate limiting and resilience

Action: Provision Redis for centralized rate limiting; keep per-instance throttling as fallback.
Owner: Platform Lead
SLA: Week 1 post-launch
Acceptance criteria: Global rate limit policy active; fail-closed behavior documented.
Rollback and disaster recovery

Action: Conduct a rollback drill with data integrity check.
Owner: SRE Lead
SLA: Week 1 post-launch
Acceptance criteria: RTO <= 15 minutes to prior version; backup/restore verified.
Operational constraints

Change freeze: No non-critical deployments until P0/P1 items above are closed.
War room: Security Lead runs point; status updates every 60 minutes until auth is restored and validated.
Monitoring additions today:
Real-time alert for auth failure rate >1% over 5 minutes
WAF false-positive counter for auth endpoints
Stripe webhook failure alerts (if enabled)
Go/No-Go gates for launch
All must be green:

Authentication restored and soak-tested; 0 auth-related 403s attributable to WAF; ≥99.5% login success in staging.
13 auth-dependent tests: 100% pass.
SEO: robots.txt and sitemap.xml live and validated.
Observability: dashboards and alerts include auth success rate, WAF triggers, signup-to-first-scholarship-viewed funnel.
Payments:
Preferred: Stripe configured and 1 successful test transaction through full credit grant flow.
Acceptable alternative: Payments fully hidden behind feature flag with no dead links; monetization enablement scheduled within 48 hours.
SLO confidence: P95 latency ≤120ms under synthetic load at projected Day-1 traffic; error rate <1%.
Launch plan (assuming gates pass)

T+0: 2-hour internal canary (company/staff accounts). KPIs: auth success ≥99.5%, WAF false positives = 0, P95 latency ≤120ms.
T+2: Soft public launch (no paid ads). KPIs for first 24 hours:
Acquisition: Unique visitors, CTR from Auto Page Maker pages, signup conversion ≥8% target for MVP.
Activation: Time-to-first-eligibility-check <5 minutes median; ≥70% of new signups complete at least one eligibility check.
Reliability: Auth error rate <0.5%, WAF false positives <0.1% of requests, uptime ≥99.9%.
Monetization (if live): Free-to-paid conversion ≥1.5% baseline; ARPU from credits ≥$4.
T+24: Decision on enabling payments if deferred; publish Day-1 ops and growth report.
T+72: Post-launch review; finalize Week 1 tasks (Redis, rollback drill scheduling, accessibility audit kickoff).
Risks and mitigations

WAF exemptions increasing attack surface: Limit scope to specific auth endpoints and JSON content types; add targeted anomaly alerts; keep full protections elsewhere.
Launch without payments (if deferred): Mitigate by capturing intent (save carts, email prompts), and commit to a 48-hour enablement window to protect early ARPU.
Essay assistance ethics: Feature remains disabled until sign-off to uphold Responsible AI and brand trust.
Resource and capital allocation (immediate)

Approve overtime for Security, Backend, QA, SEO, and Payments teams for the next 24 hours.
Prioritize infra time for Stripe secrets and SEO artifacts over new feature work.
What I need from the team now

Security Lead: ETA on WAF fix and initial staging retest start time.
QA Lead: Confirm readiness to run the 13 tests immediately after P0 and provide a test schedule.
SEO Lead: Confirm robots/sitemap deployment window and validation plan.
Payments Engineer: Confirm Stripe account access and key provisioning timeline; flag any blockers.
SRE Lead: Add the auth/WAF alerts now and confirm.
We will convene a Go/No-Go checkpoint 8 hours from now. If all gates are green, I will authorize a soft launch the same day. If the WAF fix slips beyond the 4-hour SLA, we’ll reset the launch window by 24 hours and proceed only after a fresh full regression.
