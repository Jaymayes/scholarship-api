Executive decision: NO-GO affirmed. Thank you for the thorough assessment and documentation. Reliability, security, and 24/7 operability are core product features for us—not “nice to haves.” Our Playbook makes this explicit: trust, high availability, and resilience must be engineered in from day one to protect student data and our brand, and to enable market-scale growth  . The cybersecurity posture—including a properly tuned WAF—is also non-negotiable for production readiness .

Decision on remediation plan

Choose: Recommended 3-day plan. We will not defer the Command Center; baseline observability must be live before launch to uphold our 24/7 mandate and SLOs . This aligns with our operational principle of building an integrated, end-to-end toolchain and continuous testing/DevOps discipline for safe, fast releases .
Scope and deadlines (start immediately)

Day 0 (today)

Freeze feature releases; hotfix-only until green gates.
Remove/lock down /_debug/config in all environments; verify no other debug endpoints are exposed (DEF-002).
Open “war-room” channel; twice-daily updates (standup + EOD).
Days 1–2 (parallel tracks)

Concurrency stability (DEF-001)
Tune DB pool size, connection lifetimes, and ORM settings; add load-shedding guardrails.
Target: sustain 50 RPS for 15 min with <0.1% error rate, P95 ≤120ms, no saturated pools.
WAF tuning and middleware ordering (DEF-003)
Ensure auth paths and common JSON payloads pass; write explicit allow rules for authenticated routes; preserve OWASP protections.
Target: 0 false positives on our authenticated test suite; retain blocking on OWASP top attack patterns .
Redis for rate limiting (DEF-005)
Provision managed Redis and switch limiter to distributed mode; validate across multiple app instances.
Target: consistent counters across pods; limiter survives redeploys; no user-facing throttling regressions.
Command Center baseline (DEF-004)
Stand up heartbeat, golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation), alerting, and remote kill-switch/reconfig.
Leverage our existing observability hooks; ensure dashboards + on-call alerts are wired. This is foundational for our CI/CD and continuous testing discipline .
Day 3

Full regression + load test suite; security smoke tests.
Executive sign-off review; if all launch gates are green (below), we approve limited beta rollout.
Go/No-Go launch gates (must all pass)

Performance and scale
P95 latency ≤120ms under 50 RPS for 15 min; error rate <0.1%.
Zero connection pool exhaustion events; autoscaling rules verified.
Security
No public debug endpoints; WAF blocks known attack patterns while allowing legitimate authed traffic; quick pen-test sweep on auth and config endpoints .
Operability
Command Center live: dashboards for four golden signals, runbook-linked alerts, synthetic heartbeat, remote kill-switch.
Distributed rate limiting verified across pods; safe limits configured.
Compliance/readiness
Traceable audit logs for auth and sensitive ops; privacy controls consistent with our day-one commitments to security and availability .
Accountability and owners

DEF-001 Concurrency: Platform Lead (App + DB); SRE support.
DEF-002 Debug endpoint: Backend Lead; Security Lead to verify.
DEF-003 WAF tuning: Security Lead; Infra/DevOps for middleware order.
DEF-004 Command Center: SRE Lead; DevOps for infra; QA to validate alerts.
DEF-005 Redis: Infra/DevOps; App Team to integrate client.
Budget authorization

Managed Redis: approved.
Monitoring/alerting stack: approved up to $2,000/month initial, to be revisited post-launch efficiency review.
Load testing environment hours: approved.
Your offers: yes to all four

Create detailed remediation tickets: Yes. Map DEF-001…005 with acceptance criteria tied to the launch gates above; include fix plan, ETA, and owner per item.
Set up Command Center configuration: Yes. Prioritize golden signals, on-call routing, dashboards, and kill-switch first; attach runbooks. This is essential to our 24/7 reliability and trust posture .
Generate HAR files and cURL snippets: Yes. Attach to each DEF ticket to ensure reproducibility and to validate WAF false-positive fixes.
Deeper security audit: Yes. Focus scope on auth flows, WAF rules/ordering, config exposure, and PII data paths to confirm alignment with our security-by-design commitments .
Requests/next steps for you

Share links to the six reports you referenced (EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md, FINAL_GO_NOGO_ASSESSMENT.md, etc.) so I can circulate to the CTO and Platform/Security leads; if they’re in qa_testing/ in our repo, ensure permissions for the leadership group.
Schedule the triage meeting today with owners assigned; post the ticket list and timelines in the war-room channel.
Confirm the environments for load and WAF testing (staging vs. prod with shadow traffic) and the target test profiles.
This approach preserves our brand trust and readiness to scale, which are prerequisites for our Year 1 objectives and the five-year plan to market leadership and $10M ARR. Security, resilience, and monitoring aren’t launch blockers to “work around”; they are the platform’s core product features and the bedrock for our growth engines and partner trust  .
