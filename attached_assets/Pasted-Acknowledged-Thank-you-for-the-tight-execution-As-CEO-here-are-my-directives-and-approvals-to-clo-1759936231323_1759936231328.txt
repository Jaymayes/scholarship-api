Acknowledged. Thank you for the tight execution. As CEO, here are my directives and approvals to close the gaps and protect revenue/SEO while we drive resolution.

Executive decisions and orders (effective immediately)

Proceed: EngOps to send the P0 email now. No additional approval needed. Confirm ticket ID and timestamp in #incidents-p0 within 5 minutes.
Hold line on Option B: Auto-deploy at T+6:20 if Replit has not restored service. No further sign-off required.
Pause paid, preserve demand: Marketing to pause all paid campaigns landing on /scholarships and /search. Keep brand terms active only if you can reroute to a working high-intent page (credits/packages or a temporary lead-capture page) to protect Quality Score and reduce CAC waste. Confirm campaign IDs and spend-at-risk in #incidents-p0.
Customer comms live now: Incident Commander to publish an external status page update and in-app banner within 10 minutes. Messaging: “We’re experiencing degraded availability for scholarship browsing and search. Viewing credit packages and account services remain available. No personal data is impacted.” Avoid blaming third parties; commit to updates every 30 minutes until resolved.
Replit escalation: Liaison to push for P0 acknowledgement and ETR. If no acknowledgement by T+5:45, escalate via partner contacts; if no ETR by T+6:10, escalate to Replit leadership.
Security posture confirmed: Security to re-verify Option B controls (read-only, token validation, audit logs, feature flag, secret rotation). Ensure logs have PII redaction and confirm no PII exposure in Option B. Post “Security OK” check in #incidents-p0.
SRE/EngOps readiness: Spin up synthetic monitoring from 5 regions (US/EU/APAC) for the two endpoints now, tracking 403 rate, P95 latency, and 200/304 responses. Pre-warm caches where applicable. Prepare one-command rollback of Option B via feature flag.
QA validation plan: Prepare test checklist for T+8:20: status code correctness, P95 <120ms, error rate <0.1%, SEO crawler user-agents receiving 200/304, no auth bypass for write ops. Share test IDs and endpoints to monitor.
SEO risk mitigation: Until Option B is live, set Search Console annotation; if feasible at edge, prefer 503 with Retry-After to bots over 403 to reduce SEO risk. Do not ship content changes that alter canonical URLs or sitemaps.
Finance/RevOps: Quantify revenue at risk per hour (lost conversion from browse/search), paid spend at risk, and projected ARR impact if degradation extends 4–8 hours. Share a short update in #exec within 30 minutes. Pre-approve budget for emergency edge proxy if required.
What I expect in the next 15–30 minutes

EngOps: “P0 email sent” with timestamp, ticket ID, and attachment list.
Incident Commander: Status page link, Slack update posted, timers confirmed for T+6:15 warning and T+6:20 trigger.
Marketing: List of paused campaign IDs, spend-at-risk estimate, and whether brand campaigns have been rerouted to a working page.
Security: Option B final “green” check.
QA: Test plan link and who is on point for T+8:20 validation.
Liaison: Replit acknowledgement or escalation confirmation.
Go/No-Go criteria (unchanged)

We auto-GO Option B at T+6:20 if Replit has no fix/ETR. Success = 200 OK on /scholarships and /search, 200/304 for crawlers, P95 <120ms, error rate <0.1%, writes still auth-protected.
If Option B fails to meet success criteria within 20 minutes, immediately execute the escalation path: extend NO-GO, enable Emergency Edge Proxy, then executive escalation, then Git off-ramp.
Rationale and KPI alignment

Minimizing CAC waste and preserving SEO are the fastest levers to protect near-term revenue and our 5-year ARR target. Pausing/rerouting paid prevents inefficient spend; Option B protects indexation and conversion paths.
Data-first tracking (403 rate, P95, error rate, crawler responses) ensures we act on measurable thresholds, not speculation.
Single-message templates you can copy into Slack

#incidents-p0 (now): “P0 WAF-BLOCK-20251008 update: P0 email sent to Replit, awaiting acknowledgment. Public browse/search 403s persist. Paid to /scholarships and /search paused or rerouted. Next checkpoint T+5:30. Option B auto-trigger at T+6:20 if no resolution. No PII risk. Status page: <link>”
Marketing confirmation: “Paid campaigns paused/rerouted. Paused IDs: <list>. Brand reroute: <yes/no> → <destination URL>. Spend-at-risk last 60 min: $<x>. Next update T+5:30.”
EngOps confirmation: “P0 sent at <timestamp>, Replit Ticket <ID>. Attachments: RCA_PHASE1_FINDINGS.md, P0_INCIDENT_TRACKER.md, NO_GO_REPORT.md. Synthetic monitors live in 5 regions. Next check T+5:30.”
Security confirmation: “Option B security review complete: read-only, token validation, audit logs, FF toggle, secrets rotation verified. No PII in scope.”
QA confirmation: “T+8:20 validation plan ready: latency, error rate, 200/304, UA spoof tests, write-op auth checks. Owners: <names>.”
Authority

All actions above are approved. Execute immediately and report back in #incidents-p0 with timestamps. I will remain on-call for any executive escalations or vendor engagement as needed.
