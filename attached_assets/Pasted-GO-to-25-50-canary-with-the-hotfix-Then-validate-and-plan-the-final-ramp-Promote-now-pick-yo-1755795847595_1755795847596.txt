GO to 25–50% canary with the hotfix. Then validate, and plan the final ramp.

Promote now (pick your tooling)

Helm: helm upgrade --install scholarship-api ./charts/scholarship-api --set image.tag=<hotfix-tag> --set canary.enabled=true --set canary.weight=50
Argo Rollouts: kubectl argo rollouts promote scholarship-api --to-step=2
Ingress: set canary-weight: "50" on the canary Ingress
25–50% acceptance gates (first 60–120 minutes)

SLIs: availability ≥99.9%, p95 ≤220 ms, 5xx ≤0.5%, p99 stable
Auth security: protected endpoints without Authorization → 401; malformed/alg=none/expired/wrong iss/aud → 401; valid token → 200
CORS: only allowlisted origins receive ACAO; disallowed origins get 400/403 and no CORS headers
WAF: SQLi probes blocked with 403, no app 5xx; waf_sqli_block_count increments; limiter_redis_errors = 0
Headers: RateLimit-* on 200, Retry-After on 429
Logs: no stack traces or schema leakage; jwt_replay_prevented increments on replay test
Important: close the SQLi root cause
Blocking at auth is defense-in-depth, not a fix. Before 100%:

Ensure all dynamic queries use parameterized statements (SQLAlchemy bound params or text() + params()).
Whitelist fields for ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET; validate inputs via Pydantic schemas.
Verify DB role is least-privilege and cannot perform DDL.
Test with a valid token: SQLi payloads return safe 4xx/200; DB logs show bind parameters; no schema in responses.
Keep WAF SQLi rules in block mode permanently.
Parallel tasks during the 25–50% window

Credential hygiene: complete JWT signing key rotation (disable old kid after grace), rotate DB credentials, confirm clients re-auth.
Remove the PUBLIC_READ_ENDPOINTS flag from prod code paths (or make it compile-time dev-only).
Lock CORS to prod domains; keep Vary: Origin; credentials=false unless required.
Disable/guard /docs and /openapi.json as per policy for prod.
Forensics: review API/WAF/DB logs during the vulnerable window for suspicious access and potential data exfiltration; follow breach notification policy if needed.
Go/No-Go for 100%

25–50% hold green for ≥60–120 minutes
SQLi remediation verified at code level (not only via auth/WAF)
WAF in block mode with clean app logs (no 5xx on probes)
JWT hardening confirmed (alg pinned, iss/aud/exp/nbf/jti) and replay cache active
Redis limiter healthy (errors = 0), DB pool <75%, CPU/mem <70%
Rollback triggers (abort and revert)

p95 >250 ms for 10 min, 5xx >1% for 10 min
Unexpected 200s on malformed tokens; WAF/app error spikes
Any schema leakage or stack traces in responses
limiter_redis_errors >0 for 5 min; DB pool >85%
Prevent recurrence (implement within 72 hours)

Admission/GitOps policy (OPA/Kyverno) to block prod deploys if:
PUBLIC_READ_ENDPOINTS=true or DEBUG=true
CORS contains wildcard/dev origins
Ingress exposes debug endpoints without auth
CI/CD security gates: bandit, pip-audit, secret scan, SBOM; security unit tests for JWT validation, route guards, CORS allowlist, parameterized SQL; pre-prod DAST using your PoCs.
Update runbooks (JWT rotation, WAF ops, incident response) and finalize RCA with timeline, impact, and corrective actions.
If you confirm your deploy method and the hotfix image tag, I can provide the exact command set and a one-page verification checklist for the 25–50% window and the final 100% ramp.
