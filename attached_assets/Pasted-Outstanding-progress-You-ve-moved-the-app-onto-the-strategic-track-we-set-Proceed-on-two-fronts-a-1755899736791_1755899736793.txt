Outstanding progress. You’ve moved the app onto the strategic track we set. Proceed on two fronts: a short, decisive demo, and immediate execution of the next 30‑day phase.

A. Demo request (within 48 hours)
Show the full “concierge loop” for a scripted student persona:

Magic Onboarding: Conversational intake collecting academics, activities, demographics, and need signals; confirm OCR/NLP extraction from a transcript and resume into the profile, “upload once, use many” is visible to the user .
Predictive Matching v1: Deliver a prioritized list with “likelihood to win” and transparent “why matched” factors (explicit eligibility, implicit fit, competition level). Include a quick calibration view for internal reviewers .
Application automation: Show pre-filled fields for at least one standardized portal and the Essay Coach assisting with brainstorm/structure/refine (assistant, not ghostwriter) .
Time-to-value: From “Start Onboarding” to “First 5 personalized matches” under 5 minutes. Report P95 latency and error rates for the new endpoints; confirm rate limits in logs.
KPI snapshot: Onboarding completion rate, documents uploaded per user, first-match click-through, time-to-first-match. These are the core leading indicators of “almost no effort” value delivery .
B. Next 30-day deliverables and acceptance criteria

Predictive Matching v1 in production
Ship compatibility scoring with top‑K ranking and “why matched” explanations; instrument precision@K via manual review samples.
Deliver a feature dictionary and data schema for eligibility, essay themes, deadlines (ingested and normalized) to support ranking at scale .
2. Application automation MVP

Pre-fill coverage ≥80% of required fields for at least two standardized application flows; show a read-only preview before submit; log coverage metrics .
3. Monetization (credit system live)

Credits purchasable with transparent token pricing and a 4x markup; usage metering and spend guardrails in place; grant a small starter credit on onboarding to remove friction .
4. SEO-led growth engine on

Launch programmatic pages and cornerstone guides (FAFSA, essays, deadlines). Targets: 200+ programmatic pages live, weekly publishing cadence, index coverage/CTR tracked. This is our low-CAC priority channel .
5. B2B partner portal alpha (pilot-ready)

Self-serve signup, e-sign agreements, automated verification (e.g., nonprofit status), listing creation, basic analytics. Recruit 10–15 pilot partners and open the portal to them .
6. SLOs, security, and trust

Observability dashboard with 99.9% uptime tracking and ~120ms P95 latency targets; autoscaling + multi‑AZ redundancy documented and tested .
Security controls live: strict input validation, allow lists, path normalization, least privilege, WAF, automated scans/pen tests scheduled; audit logging for PII access. Prove mitigation against directory traversal in unit/integration tests .
7. Compliance posture

Publish privacy policy and student-friendly AI use/ethics statement (no ghostwriting, transparency). Document FERPA/COPPA posture and DPIA outline per our Responsible AI commitment.
8. Weekly exec dashboard (data-first reviews)

MAUs (organic share), onboarding completion, time-to-first-match, match CTR, application starts/submissions, Essay Coach usage, credit purchase conversion, B2B pilots in pipeline, SEO impressions/clicks.
Decision

Yes—demo the Magic Onboarding flow as specified and, in parallel, continue with the 30-day implementation above. Student value drives business value; SEO-first growth reduces CAC; B2B marketplace becomes the primary ARR engine—all per the Playbook we’re executing .
Send me the demo link, KPI snapshot, and a one-page risk/issues list. I’ll review and then release the next capital allocation against the 30‑day acceptance criteria.
