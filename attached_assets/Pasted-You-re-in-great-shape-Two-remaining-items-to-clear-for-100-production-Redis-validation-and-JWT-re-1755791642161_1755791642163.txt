You’re in great shape. Two remaining items to clear for 100%: production Redis validation and JWT replay protection verification. Here’s a concise, operator-ready plan to finish and promote.

Redis production validation (blocker 1 of 2)

Connectivity and security
Use rediss:// with TLS and AUTH; verify NetworkPolicy allows app → Redis only.
Timeouts: connect ≤100 ms, read ≤200 ms; TCP keepalive on; retry with jitter.
Pool size targets: max 2–4× replicas × peak RPS/limit window; monitor pool utilization <80%.
Limiter behavior
Keys: namespace rate:app:<endpoint>:<principal>, TTL aligned to window (e.g., 60s).
Eviction policy: allkeys-lru; memory sized so limiter keys don’t thrash; watch evictions=0.
Identity: use JWT sub for authenticated, client IP for anonymous (via trusted proxy headers).
Observability gates
limiter_redis_errors = 0
Redis p95 latency <10 ms; ops/sec stable; memory fragmentation <1.5; hit rate high (if caching used).
429s ≤1% overall (exclude testers); RateLimit-* and Retry-After present on 429s.
Cross-pod consistency test
Send bursts to protected endpoints from one principal across at least two pods; confirm counters aggregate (429s appear as expected).
Restart one pod and repeat; limits persist.
Failover drill (10–15 minutes, low-traffic window)
Trigger managed Redis failover.
Expect brief increase in latency but no app 5xx; limiter degrades open (no 500s), edge rate limits remain active.
Post-failover: limiter_redis_errors returns to 0; no sustained 429 anomalies.
JWT replay protection verification (blocker 2 of 2)

Enforcement
Require jti in access tokens; reject tokens without jti in production.
On first use: SETNX jwt:jti:<id> with TTL = token exp + skew (e.g., 60s); subsequent uses rejected.
Tests
Concurrent reuse: fire two requests with same token; one 200, one 401/403; jwt_replay_prevented_total increments.
Cross-pod: perform the same test hitting different pods; still rejected.
Expiry: after token exp + skew, reuse should be allowed only with a new token; old jti no longer present.
JWKS rotation: rotate keys in IdP, confirm seamless validation (cache TTLs reasonable; iss/aud checks strict).
Monitoring
Alert on abnormal spikes of jwt_replay_prevented_total; correlate with source IPs/subjects.
Go/No-Go for 100% promotion

Last 6–12 hours at 25–50% were green on all SLIs (availability ≥99.9%, p95 ≤220 ms, 5xx ≤0.5%).
Redis validated:
HA/TLS/auth active; p95 <10 ms; limiter_redis_errors = 0; failover drill passed.
Cross-pod limiting verified; correct rate-limit headers on 200/429.
JWT replay protection validated in prod; metrics/logs confirmed.
Security posture unchanged (no wildcard CORS), OpenAI fallback <5%, DB pool <75%, CPU/mem <70%.
Recommendations endpoint contract finalized (feature_disabled response documented); eligibility endpoints validated.
Promotion to 100% (pick your tooling)

Helm
Disable canary and set stable image tag to vX.Y.Z
helm upgrade --install scholarship-api ./charts/scholarship-api --set image.tag=vX.Y.Z --set canary.enabled=false
Argo Rollouts
kubectl argo rollouts promote scholarship-api --full
NGINX Ingress
Remove canary ingress or set canary-weight to 100, then consolidate to a single stable route.
Rollback criteria (unchanged)

p95 >250 ms for 10 min, 5xx >1% for 10 min
limiter_redis_errors >0 for 5 min or Redis latency spike
Overall 429s >2% for 10 min (excluding testers)
OpenAI fallback >10% for 10 min, DB pool >85% for 5 min, or security anomaly spikes
Post-promotion (48 hours)

Heightened monitoring; synthetic journeys from multiple regions.
Game day: kill a pod, brief Redis failover, throttle OpenAI; verify graceful degradation and alerts.
Optional quick wins before 100%

Enforce pagination defaults/max on list endpoints; add ETag/Cache-Control where safe.
Idempotency keys for any write endpoints; ensure request/response size caps.
Tag all logs with correlation IDs; confirm PII redaction.
