Phenomenal execution. Approve moving into Week 5 optimization and EU expansion planning. Please send the Monday CEO dashboard, and proceed per the plan below.

Week 5 OKRs and acceptance criteria

EU expansion groundwork (planning + alpha prep)

Localize core UX and programmatic templates; implement locale formats (currency, date, address) and geo sitemaps.
Ingest and normalize 75+ EU scholarships; enable “eligible by country/region” filters in matching.
Privacy/trust: extend policy disclosures and anonymized analytics; confirm GDPR-ready flows and partner analytics remain aggregate/PII-free, consistent with our privacy posture and transparency principles 【】.
Targets: EU discovery calls scheduled with 5 prospective partners; CA/UK learnings documented to inform EU rollout. This follows the playbook’s Year 4 expansion mandate to explore international markets and deepen predictive insights for students and partners 【】.
Predictive insights optimization

Ship A/B tests on insight chips (e.g., “Your profile is in the top 10%”) with rationale and confidence bands; maintain transparent, ethical framing.
Targets: +10% additional lift in match CTR week-over-week; updated calibration report with reliability curve and Brier score. This extends the “beyond keywords” predictive approach and transparent assistance model 【】.
SEO scale and authority (low-CAC engine)

Grow 413 → 600+ programmatic pages; index coverage ≥80%; CTR ≥3.0%; publish 2 more pillar guides and expand internal linking hubs.
Reinforce SEO-led acquisition as our primary low-CAC channel per the playbook’s growth engine design 【】.
Marketplace monetization and packaging

Partners: 31 → 35–40; listings: 97 → 150+; convert 5 paid promoted listings; close 2 recruitment-as-a-service pilots with reporting access.
Introduce tiered B2B packaging (promotion + recruitment access) and begin price testing, aligned to Year 4 guidance to optimize B2B tiers and focus on enterprise contracts 【】【】.
Application automation and student value

Raise pre-fill to ≥98.8% across three standardized portals; submit-ready rate ≥92%; maintain “assistant, not ghostwriter” Essay Coach with visible disclosures and “why matched” explanations 【】.
Reliability, security, and trust

Sustain ≥99.9% uptime, ≤120 ms P95; validate multi-region latency; keep WAF + strict input validation/allow lists/path normalization/least privilege active; weekly vuln scans passing. Maintain clear privacy policy and anonymized/aggregated analytics for partners to protect students and preserve trust 【】.
Weekly KPI targets

MAUs: 36,250 → ≥50,000 with ≥60% from organic.
Monetization: credit attach 11.8% → 12.5–13%; ARPPU $34.20 → $35+; sustain 4x markup with transparent token pricing per hybrid model design 【】.
B2B: 2 enterprise pilot expansions; ≥$25k in Week 5 B2B bookings; 150+ listings live.
Two short demos by end of Week 5

EU student flow: localized onboarding → ranked matches with insight chips and “why matched” reasoning (ethical transparency) 【】【】.
Partner analytics beta: promoted listings + recruitment dashboard with anonymized trend insights and documentation of privacy protections 【】【】.
Capital allocation (Week 5)

35% SEO/content (programmatic scale, localization, pillar guides).
30% Partnerships (enterprise pilots, EU pipeline, price testing).
25% Product/ML (insight chips, calibration/fairness, automation to ≥98.8%).
10% Security/compliance/observability (privacy updates, scans, multi-region SLOs).
Risks to monitor

Regulatory/compliance drift in EU: keep policies explicit and analytics anonymized; document data flows for partner audits 【】.
SEO indexation velocity: daily sitemaps, internal linking hubs, prune thin/duplicate pages; maintain CWV hygiene 【】.
Partner conversion to paid tiers: streamline pricing and demonstrate value via promoted exposure and recruitment efficiency per playbook monetization streams 【】.
Decision

Proceed with Week 5 as above. Send the Monday CEO dashboard now; include CTR/indexation deltas, attach-rate/ARPPU trend, B2B bookings, and latency by region. If you prefer, I can deep-dive one area (EU compliance, B2B pricing tests, or calibration) before mid-week.
