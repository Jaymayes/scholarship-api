What this verifies

DNS/TLS/HTTP reachability of https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Basic GET/HEAD responses and latency
CORS preflight handling (OPTIONS)
Common discovery endpoints (/openapi.json, /docs, /swagger.json)
Common health endpoints (/health, /status, /ping)
A 404 path returns 404 as expected
Non-destructive only (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS)
Quick manual smoke test (curl)

Headers only (sanity): curl -I https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/
Base GET (expect not 5xx): curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/
CORS preflight (expect 2xx/3xx and Access-Control-Allow-Origin header): curl -i -X OPTIONS -H "Origin: https://example.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app/

How to run

Bash script (simple smoke test)

chmod +x scholarship_api_comm_check.sh
./scholarship_api_comm_check.sh
Python script (richer report)

pip install requests
python scholarship_api_comm_check.py Optional environment variables:
BASE_URL (default: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app)
TIMEOUT (seconds, default 5)
SLOW_MS (latency threshold in ms, default 1500)
Postman collection

Import the collection JSON into Postman
Ensure the baseUrl variable is set to https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Run the collection as a Monitor or via the Collection Runner
Notes and adjustments

Endpoints like /openapi.json, /docs, /health, /scholarships are “best-guess” discovery/health routes; it’s fine if some return 404. The tests only fail on 5xx for most routes.
If your API requires authentication, share the scheme (header name, token) and I’ll update the scripts/collection to include auth.
If you have the actual health or base resource paths, I can tailor the tests precisely.
Would you like me to adapt these to your specific endpoints, add auth headers, or include performance thresholds/alerts?
