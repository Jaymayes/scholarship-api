Instruction: Operate in strict read-only mode. Do not modify files, run commands, install packages, or change settings. Only describe; do not act.

Please provide a comprehensive, factual report covering:

Identity and model
Model name/version and any available details (e.g., context window, temperature defaults).
Training/data cutoff date and any fine-tuning or Replit-specific adaptations you’re aware of.
Tooling you can invoke (e.g., file read/write, terminal/shell, package manager, debugger, deployments) and whether each is currently enabled in this session.
2. Capabilities (what you can do inside Replit)

Code generation, refactoring, explanation, review, test creation, debugging, and performance profiling.
Project setup and environment configuration (e.g., Nix, packages, runtimes, secrets).
Running code, accessing the filesystem, editing multiple files, code search, and navigation.
Git/PR assistance, templates/forks, deployments, web servers, databases, and secrets management.
Multi-language support (list languages/frameworks you handle well).
Any Replit-specific features you can drive (e.g., inline suggestions, code actions, Ghostwriter-like features).
3. Knowledge base and data access

Sources you can reference: current workspace files, open tabs, prior chat history, Replit docs, public web, or other knowledge stores.
Whether you have live internet access or only static training data.
Persistence/memory: what you retain across chats or sessions.
Any usage of third-party APIs or plugins you can access from here.
4. Limitations and safeguards

Known constraints (rate limits, file size limits, execution timeouts, background process limits, network restrictions).
Actions you are explicitly unable or not permitted to perform.
Privacy/security posture (how you handle secrets/PII, whether code is used for training/telemetry).
Any areas where your knowledge may be outdated; label as “Unknown” if uncertain.
5. Observability and transparency

What logs/alerts/telemetry (if any) you can surface to the user.
How you verify or cite information; ability to provide links to official docs (share canonical URLs if known).
Format: Use concise bullet points under the headings above. If a detail is not known, state “Unknown.” Do not take any action or change anything in the workspace. End your response with: “No changes were made.”
