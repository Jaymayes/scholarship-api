Decision: GO for A2 Production Deployment (TEST Mode) and Immediate Revenue Attribution Validation.

Why (data/insight):

Strategic Gate: Validating end-to-end revenue attribution now is the mandatory prerequisite for scaling traffic via A7 (SEO). We cannot scale what we cannot measure.

Risk Control: Confining this to stripeMode: test with strict signature verification gates minimizes financial and compliance risk while proving the technical pipeline.

Readiness: A2 health, A3 test endpoints, and A5 webhook logic are all verified green. A6 instability is noted but non-blocking for B2C payment validation.

KPI impact (estimate):

Revenue Visibility: A8 Revenue Pulse transitions from NO_DATA to live metrics (totalRevenue > 0, stripeMode: test).

Data Integrity: Confirmed signature_verified: true proves the ledger is secure.

Operational Latency: Validates end-to-end payment-to-dashboard latency < 10s (target).

Risks and mitigations:

Risk: A6 instability (Provider Register) affects B2B onboarding.

Mitigation: A6 is placed in maintenance mode; root cause analysis assigned to A6 Lead parallel to this deployment.

Risk: Webhook signature failure due to secret mismatch.

Mitigation: A2 Lead must verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches the Stripe Test endpoint signing secret exactly.

Risk: Data leakage in logs.

Mitigation: Strict log hygiene enforced; PII and secrets redacted.

Next actions (owner, due date):

A2 Lead: Configure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY & STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (Test) -> Publish. Post /health JSON. (Deadline: T+10 min)

A3 Lead: Execute $1.00 test purchase: curl -X POST .../api/e2e/revenue-attribution. Post Transaction ID. (Deadline: T+20 min)

A5 Lead: Verify logs for signature_verified: true and 200 OK to Stripe. Post log snippet. (Deadline: T+30 min)

A8 Lead: Confirm Revenue Pulse Tile: stripeMode: test, totalRevenue > 0. Post JSON. (Deadline: T+40 min)

A6 Lead: Diagnose "Internal Server Error" root cause and provide fix ETA. (Deadline: T+60 min)

Open data gaps/assumptions:

Assumption: The configured STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET corresponds to the correct Stripe endpoint URL.

Execute. Post the required artifacts immediately upon completion. I will authorize A7 SEO deployment only after all gates (G1-G3) are passed.
