Decision: Proceed with Option A now, time‑box it, and auto‑fallback to Option B if not resolved within 2 hours.

Rationale

This is a platform WAF issue at Google Frontend on Replit, not an application defect. Infrastructure-side remediation avoids technical debt and preserves our clean code path.
We must protect our SLOs and the B2C funnel (search/scholarships are core to conversion and SEO). Clean infra remediation first, with a tightly scoped fallback if delays persist.
Replit’s shared infrastructure can impose constraints on production-grade workloads; moving fast with the platform owner is the lowest-risk path, with a prepared fallback consistent with resilient systems practice (retries/fallbacks) while we wait on infra resolution .
Immediate directives and timeline
0–15 minutes

Confirm WAF access: EngOps checks whether we have Replit WAF configuration access. If yes, proceed to add exceptions; if no, file P0 support immediately.
Declare a P0 incident internally. Post status in our status channel and add a temporary user-facing banner for affected flows to minimize confusion.
Pause any paid traffic pushing users into the broken endpoints to avoid wasted CAC; keep organic SEO live but with graceful messaging.
15–30 minutes

If we have WAF access: Add targeted allow rules for:
GET /api/v1/scholarships
GET /api/v1/search Then validate with the provided curl reproducers and header captures. Ship once verified 200 OK externally.
If we do not have WAF access: File an urgent Replit support ticket (see template below) with P0 severity. Attach:
RCA_PHASE1_FINDINGS.md sequence diagrams, middleware/unit test verification
Header captures and curl repro steps
App/log evidence showing zero app-level WAF blocks and working localhost/proxy tests
T+2 hours checkpoint (auto-fallback trigger)

If Replit has not implemented a working exception and external GETs still 403:
Execute Option B: implement the Replit-specific auth bypass using an internal token for the two public endpoints.
Security requirements:
Token must be scoped to read-only for scholarships/search, rotated daily, stored in Replit Secrets, and validated server-side.
Strict path match on only the two endpoints; log and rate-limit; no PII exposure; add audit logging.
ETA: 1 hour for implementation + testing. Launch behind a feature flag; remove as soon as Option A is live.
T+4 hours checkpoint

If Option B is live and stable, keep the P0 ticket open with Replit and request a WAF exception ETA. The moment Option A is confirmed fixed, remove the bypass and close the incident.
Accountability

Incident commander: EngOps lead
Replit liaison: Partnerships/Support owner
QA: App team to run the provided curl tests and automated checks
Comms: Marketing to coordinate user messaging and pause/resume paid campaigns
KPIs to monitor (hourly during incident)

External 403 rate on /scholarships and /search
Conversion rate across the student acquisition funnel (visit → engaged search → started application)
Error budget burn vs 99.9% uptime SLO
SEO landing page bounce rate attributable to blocked endpoints
Support ticket template (for Option A when WAF dashboard access is unavailable)

Subject: P0: Replit WAF (Google Frontend) incorrectly blocking public GET endpoints
Project/App IDs: [insert IDs]
Impact: External GET requests to /api/v1/scholarships and /api/v1/search return 403 from Google Frontend; breaks core discovery flow for users.
Expected: 200 OK (application WAF allows all GET; middleware ordering verified; localhost tests pass)
Observed:
Response headers: server: Google Frontend; via: 1.1 google
Application logs: no WAF block entries for external requests
Localhost + proxy headers: 200 OK
External GET /credits/packages: 200 OK (suggests endpoint-specific WAF rule)
Reproduction: Include the exact curl commands and header captures
Attachments: RCA_PHASE1_FINDINGS.md + middleware/unit test evidence + header diffs
Request: Add WAF exceptions for GET /api/v1/scholarships and GET /api/v1/search at the platform edge
Urgency: P0 customer-impacting. Please confirm receipt and ETA
Risk and compliance notes

Option B bypass remains read-only and minimally scoped; ensure no student PII traverses these endpoints and all requests are TLS-encrypted, with secrets handled via Replit Secrets per best practice .
This incident underscores the need for resilient fallbacks for critical read paths. Our architecture standards call for planned fallbacks and graceful degradation to protect user experience and funnel metrics .
Longer-term, given platform constraints and vendor lock-in risks, we should define an exit ramp for mission-critical public endpoints (reverse proxy under our control or multi-provider front door) to reduce exposure to vendor WAF misconfigurations .
Confirmations needed

Do we have Replit WAF configuration access today? If yes, EngOps proceeds immediately with the targeted allow rules. If not, file the P0 support ticket now and start the 2-hour Option B fallback timer.
I’ll stay on this until external 200s are verified and the student experience is fully restored.
