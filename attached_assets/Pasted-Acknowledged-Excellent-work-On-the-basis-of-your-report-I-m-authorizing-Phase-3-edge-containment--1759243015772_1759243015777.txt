Acknowledged. Excellent work. On the basis of your report, I’m authorizing Phase 3 edge containment with a staged rollout, contingent on the pre-flight checklist below.

Executive decision

Go for Phase 3 cutover using staged WAF rules (Log → Block) exactly as specified in the implementation guide.
Schedule T0 in a low-traffic window within the next 24–48 hours. Preference: 02:00–04:00 UTC.
Maintain SLOs: 99.9% uptime, target P95 ~120ms (hard cap 200ms during cutover), zero unexplained auth regressions.
Pre-flight checklist (must be green before T0)

Baselines captured (last 24h): P50/P95 latency, 5xx rate, auth success rate, WAF anomaly count, top routes by traffic.
Dashboards and alerts live: edge (Cloudflare), application, and DB; P0/P1/P2 paging tested.
Freeze: application deploys frozen T-4h to T+4h; migrations locked.
Rollback prepared: DNS/TLS rollback plan validated; application rollback image tagged and tested.
Redis plan: confirm Day 1–2 provisioning owner and ETA (to replace in-memory rate limiting) with HA config.
T0 runbook (staged rollout)

Stage 1 (Log-only, 45–60 min): Enable Cloudflare rules in log mode; warm caches; monitor diffs vs baselines.
Stage 2 (Block, limited rules, 60 min): Turn on block for high-confidence rules; monitor false positives; keep transform rules active.
Stage 3 (Full policy): Ramp remaining rules; confirm no material impact on auth conversion or error rates.
Live cutover KPIs and guardrails

5xx error rate: maintain ≤0.5%; rollback threshold sustained >1.0% for 10 min.
Auth success rate: no more than +0.2% absolute drop; rollback if ≥0.5% drop for 10 min.
P95 latency: stay ≤200ms; investigate if >200ms for 10 min; rollback if >250ms for 10 min.
WAF false positives: ≤0.05% of requests; if ≥0.1% for 10 min with student impact, revert last rule change.
Traffic integrity: no surge in anomalous routes; confirm path normalization working.
JWT rotation #2

Execute dual-key rollover post-Stages 1–2 stabilization (same maintenance window).
Overlap window ≥30 minutes; live-monitor auth success and token verification logs.
Success criteria: zero spike in 401s/403s; confirm old key fully retired.
Ownership and comms

Incident Commander (Infra): owns go/no-go and rule ramp decisions.
Security Lead: owns WAF policy, transform rules, and rollback triggers tied to false positives.
App Lead: owns application health, JWT rotation #2, and route inventory snapshots.
Comms Lead: owns internal status updates every 30 minutes and external status page if needed.
Replit P0: submit the prepared template at T0, target 2-hour acknowledgment; attach live evidence.
Rollback criteria (any one triggers rollback)

Breach of any guardrail above for >10 minutes.
Material student sign-in or submission impact confirmed by logs or support signals.
Cloudflare configuration anomalies (DNS/SSL/TLS) not correctable within 10 minutes.
Post-cutover (T+24h and T+72h)

T+24h stabilization report: KPIs vs baseline, rule adjustments, incident log, and student impact analysis.
T+72h post-incident review: root cause of platform/proxy exposure, control efficacy, remaining risks, and next actions.
Additional priorities (next 48–72h)

Redis rate limiting: deploy HA Redis (AOF on, multi-AZ), migrate from in-memory, run synthetic load to validate.
Logpush/analytics: enable Cloudflare Logpush to centralized storage; join with app logs for false-positive analysis.
Synthetic monitoring: two external vantage points for sign-in and top three student flows; alert to P95 and error thresholds.
Admin surface hardening: confirm Cloudflare IP allowlist for admin endpoints; enforce TLS 1.2+, HSTS, disable 0-RTT for auth endpoints.
What I need from you to proceed

Proposed T0 window and named owners for the four roles above.
Current 24h baselines for latency, error rate, auth success, and top routes.
Confirmation that Replit P0 ticket is pre-drafted and ready to send at T0.
Once I have those three items, I’ll issue the formal go order. Stay in a ready posture; assume go within 24 hours.
