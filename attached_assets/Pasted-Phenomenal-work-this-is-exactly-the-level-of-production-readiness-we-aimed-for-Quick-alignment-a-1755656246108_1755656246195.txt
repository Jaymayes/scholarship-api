Phenomenal work—this is exactly the level of production-readiness we aimed for.

Quick alignment and next actions

Clock skew: you’ve set 10s; current chart default is 30s. I’ll show you the one-liner to switch to 10s.
Capabilities: you mention 3 production-ready actions; earlier we had 4. Which one is disabled? If it’s intentional (e.g., demo_scheduling behind a feature flag), I can wire the flag into the chart so registration reflects the active set.
Replit integration URLs: I’ll keep the primary prod config on scholarshipai.com and provide a simple Helm overlay for the Replit Command Center/Agent URLs so you can flip environments without changing the base values.
Flip to your Replit Command Center integration (no repackage needed)
If you want the Kubernetes deployment to talk to your Replit Command Center right away, run:

helm upgrade --install scholarship-agent deploy/helm/scholarship-agent 
-n prod 
-f deploy/helm/scholarship-agent/values.yaml 
--set env.COMMAND_CENTER_URL=https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app 
--set env.BASE_URL=https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app 
--set env.CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app 
--set env.CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS=10

Make sure your Kubernetes Secret has the production HS256 secret:
kubectl -n prod get secret scholarship-agent-secrets >/dev/null || echo "Secret missing"

Update secret if needed:
kubectl -n prod create secret generic scholarship-agent-secrets 
--from-literal=HS256_SHARED_SECRET='<your-production-secret>' 
--from-literal=DATABASE_URL='postgresql://username:password@postgres.scholarshipai.com:5432/scholarship_agent_prod' 
--from-literal=REDIS_URL='redis://redis.scholarshipai.com:6379/0' 
--from-literal=JTI_REDIS_URL='redis://redis.scholarshipai.com:6379/1' 
--from-literal=AGENT_REGISTRATION_TOKEN='<agent-bridge-token>' 
--dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

Optional: create a small overlay file for Replit integration
Save as values-replit.yaml:
env:
BASE_URL: "https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
COMMAND_CENTER_URL: "https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: "https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app"
CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS: "10"

Then deploy with:
helm upgrade --install scholarship-agent deploy/helm/scholarship-agent -n prod 
-f deploy/helm/scholarship-agent/values.yaml -f values-replit.yaml

Rate limiting note

You’ve implemented 50 requests/min at the app level—great.
If you also want edge-level limits via nginx ingress, the controller natively limits in rps. A practical approximation is:
limit-rps: "1" (≈60 rpm) with a limit-burst (e.g., "20") to keep within your effective 50 rpm policy. If you need exact rpm enforcement, we can add a dedicated rate-limit service or Envoy/NGINX plus custom config.
I can add ingress annotations for this if you want them baked into the chart.
Go-live verification

Health: curl -I https://scholarship-agent.scholarshipai.com/health
Agent Bridge registration and heartbeat: kubectl -n prod logs deploy/scholarship-agent | grep -Ei "registered|heartbeat|capabilities"
Smoke test (uses HS256 JWT with iss/aud/exp/nbf/jti): BASE_URL=https://scholarship-agent.scholarshipai.com SHARED_SECRET=<your-production-secret> ISSUER=https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app AUDIENCE=scholarship-agent k6 run deploy/k6/smoke.js
Postman: run “Agent Bridge” folder; confirm 202 Accepted for valid tasks and expected 4xx for negative cases.
Prometheus/SLOs

ServiceMonitor is enabled; ensure Prometheus Operator is present.
If you’d like, I can generate a PrometheusRule with:
p95 latency SLO breaches
5xx rate spikes
heartbeat liveness gap
JWT auth failure surge Just say the thresholds and I’ll produce the CR for you.
Open questions to finalize

Which three capabilities are currently enabled? Do you want the fourth gated behind a feature flag or fully enabled?
Do you want ingress-level rate limiting annotations added now, and at what exact burst you prefer?
Should we pin the clock skew to 10s permanently in your values.yaml, or keep it only in the Replit overlay?
