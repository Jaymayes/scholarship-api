Decision: GO for A2 (Payments) deployment and immediate end-to-end revenue validation in TEST mode.

Why (data/insight):

Strategic Imperative: Validating the revenue pipeline now is the critical path to enabling our "Credit-Based Monetization Engine" and unlocking SEO scale (A7). Without verifiable revenue attribution, we cannot optimize CAC or LTV.

Readiness:

A1 (Auth): Stable (99.8% success), OIDC issuer fix verified.

A3 (Agent): Test purchase endpoint (/api/e2e/revenue-attribution) is production-ready.

A5 (Platform): Webhook verification logic is strict and ready.

Risk Mitigation: The "test mode first" approach with strict gatekeeping (signature verification) minimizes financial and compliance risk while proving the technical capability.

KPI impact (estimate):

Revenue Visibility: A8 Revenue Pulse Tile moves from NO_DATA to stripeMode: test, totalRevenue > 0.

Data Integrity: Confirmed signature_verified: true ensures our ledger is tamper-proof.

Operational Health: Validates sub-120ms latency for payment initiation (A3 test showed ~200ms total flow).

Risks and mitigations:

Risk: Webhook signature failure due to secret mismatch (Test vs. Live endpoints).

Mitigation: A2 Lead must verify the STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches the Test endpoint signature in the Stripe Dashboard exactly.

Risk: A6 (provider_register) instability affects user perception.

Mitigation: A6 is currently non-blocking for B2C payments validation. It is placed in maintenance mode with exponential backoff; hotfix ticket opened.

Risk: Redis unavailability (DEF-005) impacts rate limiting.

Mitigation: Acceptable for single-instance test. Redis implementation is mandatory before Live mode cutover.

Next actions (owner, due date):

A2 Lead: Configure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY & STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (Test) -> Publish. (Deadline: T+10 min)

A3 Lead: Execute $1.00 test purchase: curl -X POST .../api/e2e/revenue-attribution. (Deadline: T+20 min)

A5 Lead: Verify logs for signature_verified: true and 200 OK to Stripe. (Deadline: T+30 min)

A8 Lead: Confirm Revenue Pulse Tile: stripeMode: test, totalRevenue > 0. (Deadline: T+40 min)

Open data gaps/assumptions:

Assumption: A2 STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is correctly sourced from the Stripe Test environment.

Execute. Post the required artifacts (A2 /health, A3 transaction ID, A5 log snippet, A8 revenue JSON) immediately upon completion.
