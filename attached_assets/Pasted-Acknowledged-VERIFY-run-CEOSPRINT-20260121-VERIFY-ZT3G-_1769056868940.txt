Acknowledged. VERIFY run CEOSPRINT-20260121-VERIFY-ZT3G-V2S2-028 completed with Conditional GO, SLO met, B2B live, B2C ready (charges gated). Here’s the concise CEO sign‑off packet and next steps to reach Definitive GO with B2C still safety‑gated.

Executive summary (ready now)

Status: VERIFIED LIVE (ZT3G) — CONDITIONAL GO
Health: 8/8 apps 200 OK via public URLs; content markers validated; no “Waking” pages
SLO: P95 ≈ 86.8–108 ms (target ≤120 ms) PASS
B2B: LIVE (3 providers; fee lineage 3% + 4x correlated in ledger + A8)
B2C: READINESS ONLY (stripe.js + pk present; secure cookies; session OK). Live charges remain blocked until HITL override
Telemetry: A8 round‑trip verified (3‑of‑3); TEST/AUDIT event types accepted
Schema resilience: status_family widened (varchar(10)) deployed
Immediate actions (next 30–60 min)

Confirm production parity

version_manifest.json and post_republish_diff.md show production public URLs serving the same SHA you verified. If not, republish now.
Close any stale incidents

If an A1 SEV2 stub remains from earlier cold starts, close it (DB healthy, cookies verified).
Enable telemetry backfill job

Ensure spooled events replay to A8 now that it’s healthy (a8_telemetry_audit.md confirms POST+GET + checksum).
Lock B2C in readiness

Keep Stripe safety paused (4/25 remaining). Do not execute any live charges until HITL override is recorded.
HITL override (when you’re ready for one $0.50 micro‑charge + refund)

Record approval (exact text) in tests/perf/reports/hitl_approvals.log: [UTC timestamp] HITL-CEO-APPROVE B2C_MICROCHARGE run_id=CEOSPRINT-20260121-VERIFY-ZT3G-V2S2-028 reason="Single $0.50 verification; immediate refund; 3-of-3 proof"
Replit Agent will then execute one $0.50 charge and <60s refund with 3‑of‑3 evidence, generate:
b2c_checkout_trace.json, refund_confirmations.json, updated b2c_funnel_verdict.md, ecosystem_double_confirm.md
Canary rollout (traffic and growth)

Marketing/SEO: Go live with Auto Page Maker campaigns (5% crawl/launch), confirm sitemap coverage and fresh page build in seo_verdict.md
Ramp: 5% (10 min) → 25% (30 min) → 50% (60 min) → 100% (24h soak)
Rollback triggers (any stage): P95>150 ms for 10 min, error≥0.5%, A8 ingestion<98%, ledger mismatch. Document stage outcomes in go_no_go_report.md
Operational watchlist (next 24h)

A8 stability: Backfill queue drains; ingestion ≥99% (a8_telemetry_audit.md)
Rate limiting: Escalating suppression active; consider adding chronic abusers to IP_BLOCKLIST env
Privacy-by-default: headers (GPC/DNT) and FERPA redaction confirmed (security_headers_report.md, dataservice_security.md)
Canary canary/monitor: Dev instances use relaxed thresholds; prod uses 150 ms, avoid cross‑env false positives
Artifact index (already generated, SHA256 verified)

go_no_go_report.md, system_map.json, perf_summary.md
b2b_funnel_verdict.md, b2c_funnel_verdict.md (readiness)
a1_cookie_validation.md, a8_telemetry_audit.md
ecosystem_double_confirm.md (2‑of‑3/3‑of‑3 matrix)
hitl_approvals.log, raw_truth_summary.md, checksums.json
If you want the Replit Agent to proceed with the safe, readiness‑only go‑live (no charges), reply:
“Proceed with canary rollout at 5% and maintain B2C readiness (no charges).”

If you want to verify payments end‑to‑end, reply with the HITL line above (or confirm “Approve micro‑charge now”), and I’ll execute the single $0.50 + refund with 3‑of‑3 evidence.
