Outstanding progress. Approved to proceed with Priority 2 Day 2 as outlined. Execute in this order with clear acceptance criteria and a 48-hour timebox.

CI performance budgets and gates
Actions
Define traffic profiles for CI: baseline 1–2 RPS per key GET (list, detail, search), short burst 5–10 RPS to catch tail latencies without stressing infra. Calibrate so it’s safe for your env.
Capture latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99), error rate, and non-200s. Export artifacts to the CI summary and store JSON/CSV for 10-run trend.
Track server resource signals during the test if available: CPU, memory, DB query p95, connection pool saturation, timeouts.
Targets
p95 ≤ 120 ms; p99 ≤ 300 ms on read endpoints.
Error rate < 0.1%; zero 5xx.
DB connection pool saturation < 80%; no timeouts.
Acceptance
CI job fails on budget breach; trend visible for last 10 runs.
A short performance report attached to each PR (auto-generated summary).
2. Error schema standardization (extend beyond 404/405)

Actions
Enforce a single JSON error envelope across all failures: {code, message, correlation_id, details?}.
Clarify semantics and mapping:
400 vs 422: 400 for syntactic issues; 422 for valid JSON with semantic/validation errors.
401 vs 403: 401 when no/invalid auth; 403 when authenticated but forbidden.
404 unknown route/object; 405 method not allowed; 409 conflict; 429 include Retry-After.
5xx never leaks internals; always includes correlation_id.
Expand negative-path contract tests: invalid IDs, invalid types, missing/invalid auth (if applicable), rate-limit breach, unknown route.
Update docs with examples per status.
Acceptance
Contract tests pass for all negative cases; CI fails on schema drift.
Docs show copy-paste examples for each error type.
3. Custom metrics optimization for observability

Actions
Confirm active_scholarships_total is emitted via the unified registry and reconciles on startup and data mutations (post-commit or periodic).
Add domain metrics with strict label discipline:
scholarships_indexed_total (counter)
search_requests_total (counter, labels: result=ok|error)
search_results_count (histogram, bucketed sizes)
Guardrails: only env, service, version labels; no user-input labels. Add flatline and abrupt-change alerts.
If tracing is enabled, attach exemplars to key histograms/counters for trace jump-to.
Acceptance
Metrics visible on /metrics; dashboards wired; no high-cardinality warnings.
Alerts fire on flatline/zero and recover appropriately.
Governance, timing, and outputs

Timebox: 48 hours for Day 2.
Deliverables:
CI artifacts: performance report with budgets, last 10-run trend, and gate status.
Error schema reference and negative-path contract test report.
Metrics screenshots and PromQL queries demonstrating reconciliation and domain metrics.
Risks and contingencies:
If CI budgets are noisy, stabilize by fixing sample size, isolating env variability, or adding warm-up runs before measurements.
If any target is missed, stop and submit a root-cause brief with mitigation options before proceeding.
Confirm any staging constraints for the CI load step (allowed RPS and test window), then proceed.
