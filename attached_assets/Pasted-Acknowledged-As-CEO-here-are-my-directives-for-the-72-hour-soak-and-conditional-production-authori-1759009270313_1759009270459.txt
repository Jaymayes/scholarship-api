Acknowledged. As CEO, here are my directives for the 72-hour soak and conditional production authorization.

Executive decision

Status: GO. Continue the 72-hour soak as planned. Default GO unless a red gate triggers.
Conditional canary approval: If Day 2 chaos testing passes the criteria below, initiate canary on Day 3 without waiting for additional approval.
Day 2 pass criteria (must all hold across core journeys)

Reliability: Availability ≥99.9%, P95 latency ≤120ms, error budget consumption ≤10% of 30-day budget during soak.
Security: 0 critical/high findings; no privacy incidents; audit logs ≥99% coverage for access to PII.
Data integrity: No data loss; backups and point-in-time recovery validated; shadow writes match control within 99.9% consistency on key tables.
Business protection:
SEO: Indexable pages within ±5% of expected, soft-404s not >1% of indexed pages, Core Web Vitals P75 LCP ≤2.5s and CLS ≤0.1.
Provider APIs: Success rate ≥99.5%, P95 latency ≤150ms, contract tests 100% pass.
Canary rollout plan (auto-execute if Day 2 passes)

Ramp: 5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% traffic, 60-minute soak per step, two regions first, then global.
Windows: Ramp only 08:00–18:00 UTC. Freeze changes during ramp.
Rollback: Immediate automatic rollback on any red gate; preserve diagnostics and freeze deployments pending executive review.
Data-first KPIs to report daily at 10:00 UTC (and in the Day 3 packet)

Reliability: Availability, latency by journey, error budget burn-down, top 5 failure modes and MTTR.
Security/Compliance: Vuln posture (new/closed), DLP/PII alerts, access audit anomalies, FERPA/COPPA checks, third-party tracker audit diffs.
SEO engine (Auto Page Maker): New pages published, indexation rate, impression/click growth, soft-404/duplicate/canonicalization counts, CWV P75 by template, crawl budget utilization.
B2C funnel:
Free→paid conversion, time-to-first-match, application-start and completion rates, credit ARPU, refund/chargeback rate, NPS/CSAT.
B2B funnel: Active providers, API success/latency, offer freshness (median days since update), revenue from 3% fee, provider NPS.
Unit economics: Infra cost/request, gross margin on AI services (≥4x markup enforced), CAC by channel (paid spend remains at $0 through soak), projected LTV/CAC under current conversion/ARPU.
Regressions: Shadow A/B non-inferiority vs control with a −3% relative margin on conversion and completion rates (95% CI). Flag if worse.
Guardrails and constraints (enforce now)

Growth: No paid acquisition during soak. Prioritize SEO scale with quality safeguards (noindex low-quality pages until quality score threshold; strict canonicalization; sitemap hygiene).
Pricing/monetization: Run shadow tests only; do not expose net-new pricing to 100% of users. Maintain 4x AI service markup and 3% provider fee in production paths.
Risk and ethics: No features that could facilitate academic dishonesty. Bias evaluation on scholarship matching models included in Day 3 packet with mitigation actions.
Specific execution orders

Run Day 1 spike tests and capture saturation points with autoscaling cost curves; attach elasticity plots to tomorrow’s report.
Validate disaster recovery RPO/RTO during Day 2 chaos; include screenshot evidence and restore timing.
Add SEO thin-content sentinel: automatic noindex if word count, engagement, or similarity score falls below thresholds; include counts in daily report.
Provider API contract tests must run on every deploy gate; include any schema drift events and backward-compat handling taken.
Instrument “time-to-first-reward” (first quality match) as a primary experience KPI and include it in the top-level dashboard.
Communications plan

Internal: Real-time alerts for any red gates to executive channel with one-paragraph impact/ETA to resolve.
External: If canary reaches ≥50% without incident, prepare provider-facing status update and changelog; publish final public release notes post 100% rollout.
Trust/Compliance: Update Trust Center with SLO performance, model cards, DPIA summary, and audit log posture after Day 3 decision.
Capital and cost controls

Cap incremental infra spend during soak at +15% over baseline; alert if exceeded with root cause.
Do not expand model footprint or context windows during soak without written approval.
What I need in tomorrow’s 10:00 UTC report

One-page executive summary with traffic, reliability, security, SEO, B2C/B2B KPIs, and unit economics vs targets.
Shadow A/B readout on conversion and application completion (with CI).
Top 3 risks discovered, owner, and mitigation ETA.
Canary readiness checklist status against the criteria above.
Default posture remains GO. If all criteria hold through Day 2, proceed with the Day 3 canary ramp exactly as specified. I will render the final Go/No-Go by 2025-09-30 18:00 UTC or earlier if a red gate triggers.
