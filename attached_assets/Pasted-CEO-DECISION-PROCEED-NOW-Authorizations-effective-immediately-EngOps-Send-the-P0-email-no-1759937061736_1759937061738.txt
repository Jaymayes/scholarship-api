CEO DECISION — PROCEED NOW

Authorizations (effective immediately)

EngOps: Send the P0 email now. Include the attachments and request acknowledgment, ETR, live triage contact, and the specific GFE/WAF rule ID. Post confirmation in #incidents-p0 when sent.
Incident Commander: Publish the status page message and in-app banner now. Post the #incidents-p0 update using the provided template, set the T+6:15 alarm, and confirm “Status page published + baseline complete.”
Marketing: Pause all paid campaigns landing on /scholarships and /search, reroute brand campaigns to /credits/packages, and document spend at risk. Confirm in #incidents-p0.
Finance: Begin immediate impact analysis (hourly conversion loss, ARR impact, CAC waste, SEO risk exposure) and post results in #exec.
Security: Confirm bypass token owner, schedule daily rotation, verify Replit Secrets storage, and confirm PII redaction. Post “Security OK” in #incidents-p0. For reference, follow our Replit Secrets management guidance outlined in the deployment readiness documentation .
Option B Auto-Deploy — Pre-approved

Gate at T+6:15: GO Option B if Replit has not provided both: (1) confirmed root cause with the specific GFE/WAF rule ID and (2) a credible ETR ≤ 30 minutes with mitigation underway. HOLD if both are provided; extend hold to T+6:45, then deploy if not resolved by then.
If GO, Option B auto-deploys at T+6:20; ETA ~20 minutes; QA validation gate at T+8:20. No additional sign-off required.
Why this action now

Student value and revenue protection: Our core discovery endpoints are returning 403 across regions and SEO crawlers are blocked, directly harming students’ ability to find scholarships and crippling organic acquisition. Pausing paid traffic prevents CAC waste while we restore service.
Data-first: The synthetic baseline shows 100% failures with good latency (i.e., blocked at the edge), justifying an immediate P0 and vendor escalation.
Platform-level evidence: Replit’s autoscale analytics provide HTTP status breakdowns; use these to corroborate the live 403 rate and validate recovery during and after mitigation .
Resilience posture: This outage underscores our need to maintain Option B and continue hardening with explicit resiliency patterns and vendor contingencies, consistent with our systems guidance to enhance resiliency and plan migration paths for mission-critical components if needed .
Execution timeline (confirm each milestone in #incidents-p0)

Now through T+6:10: Execute the manual actions above; Security posts “Security OK.”
T+5:30: Check for Replit response.
T+6:15: GO/NO-GO on Option B (per gate above).
T+6:20: Option B auto-deploy (if GO).
T+6:45: If HOLD at T+6:15, re-evaluate; deploy if still not resolved.
T+8:20: QA validation gate (use QA_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md).
Additional directives

Vendor management: Partnerships to open a parallel escalation with Replit contacts; request immediate technical bridge, written RCA Phase 1 within 24 hours, confirm GFE/WAF rule ID, and review SLA/credit eligibility.
Analytics hygiene: Tag the incident window across all BI dashboards; exclude from ongoing marketing and funnel performance analyses to prevent skewed KPIs.
Post-incident: Draft a customer-facing follow-up and internal postmortem with clear owner actions, prevention measures, and any changes to our resiliency plan.
