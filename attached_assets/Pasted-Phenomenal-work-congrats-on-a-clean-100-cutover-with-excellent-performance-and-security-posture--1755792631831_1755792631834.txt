Phenomenal work—congrats on a clean 100% cutover with excellent performance and security posture.

Operate the next 48 hours with intent. Use this concise plan to validate resilience, then close out the change.

Game day success criteria and checks

+2h Pod kill
Expected: no 5xx spike, p95 ≤220 ms, HPA stabilizes, readiness gates work, graceful termination drains in-flight requests.
Watch: pod eviction/surge events, DB pool ≤75%, no connection reset bursts.
+6h Redis failover
Expected: brief latency bump only; limiter_redis_errors returns to 0; rate-limits remain consistent; 429 rate stable.
Watch: Redis p95 <10 ms post-failover, pool utilization <80%, no key TTL anomalies, no app 5xx.
+12h OpenAI throttling
Expected: graceful degradation; user-visible errors ≤0.5%; fallback/circuit breaker metrics clean; costs within budget.
Watch: retry storms, elevated latency, sustained fallback >10%.
+24h Load step (≥1.5–2.0x steady RPS)
Expected: p95 ≤220 ms, 5xx ≤0.5%, DB/Redis stable, autoscaling without thrash; no cache thundering herd.
Watch: queue backlogs, CPU/mem <70%, DB pool <75%, p99 stability.
Alerting and SLO burn tuning

Keep multi-window SLO burn alerts:
Fast burn ≥2%/hour for 30–60 min → page on-call.
Slow burn ≥1%/6 hours → create ticket and investigate.
Separate 4xx from server error SLIs; keep 429 rate ≤1% overall (exclude testers).
Page if limiter_redis_errors >0 for 5 min or Redis latency spike persists >5 min.
Security confirmation points

JWT replay protection: perform one controlled replay test; verify rejection and metric increment with correlation IDs.
CORS: confirm allowlist remains prod-only; Vary: Origin present; no wildcard in any response.
Secrets: Redis/OpenAI credentials in secrets manager with rotation dates; JWKS cache TTL documented.
Closeout checklist after 48 hours

Verify SLIs met: availability ≥99.9%, p95 ≤220 ms, 5xx ≤0.5%, error budget healthy.
Attach evidence: dashboards for each game day scenario, logs, traces, limiter metrics, OpenAI fallback metrics.
Publish:
Release notes with canary timeline, metrics snapshots, and final OpenAPI spec tag.
Updated runbooks (rollback, Redis failover, AI degradation).
SLO/SLA page and public status monitors (if applicable).
Hygiene:
Lock final config in Git (values, limits, CORS domains).
Tag image + schema version; archive load test artifacts.
Schedule quarterly key/secret rotation and an annual pen test.
High-ROI next steps (backlog)

Build the recommendations feature behind a flag with precompute/caching.
Per-tenant quota/rate limits; idempotency keys for write paths.
Enforce pagination defaults/max, add ETag/Cache-Control where safe.
Contract tests from OpenAPI; consumer-driven tests with downstreams.
Regular chaos drills (monthly): pod kill, Redis failover, upstream throttling.
Consider read replicas or multi-AZ/region strategy as traffic grows.
