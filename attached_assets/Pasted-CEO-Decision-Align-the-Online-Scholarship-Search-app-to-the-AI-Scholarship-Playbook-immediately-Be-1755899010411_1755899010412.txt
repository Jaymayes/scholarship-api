CEO Decision: Align the Online Scholarship Search app to the AI Scholarship Playbook immediately. Below is the crisp alignment plan, tied to our 5-year objective and the playbook’s product, growth, monetization, and infrastructure mandates.

What “aligned” means (product scope we must ship)

Student experience: Move beyond basic search to an AI-powered concierge delivering “almost no effort” discovery and application support. Core features:
Magic Onboarding (guided profile intake via conversational AI) and an AI Document Hub with OCR/NLP for “upload once, use many” documents (transcripts, resumes, essays) .
Predictive Matching engine that ranks opportunities by personalized “likelihood to win,” not keywords, using explicit eligibility, implicit fit, historical winners, and competition level .
Application automation: intelligent form-filling/RPA, plus an Essay Coach that brainstorms, structures, and refines student-written drafts ethically (assistant, not ghostwriter), and a deadlines/workflow tracker in the dashboard .
Why this is non-negotiable: The market’s friction causes >$1B unclaimed scholarships and 12.5% overall award rates; our competitive advantage is eliminating “effort cost” at scale .
Monetization and pricing (dual-engine model)

B2C: Keep signup free; monetize advanced AI with credits priced transparently by model tokens at a 4x markup; credits never expire .
B2B Marketplace: Build the institutional side as the primary ARR engine: listing/promotion fees, recruitment-as-a-service, and an analytics/data suite for partners .
Rationale and targets: B2C conversions are structurally low; we scale students organically and monetize B2B for healthy unit economics. Five-year plan targets include Year 1 focus on user base, Year 2 initial monetization, and B2B scaling from Years 3–5 to reach $10M+ ARR total revenue trajectory .
Growth engine (low-CAC first)

Prioritize SEO/content over paid ads; build an “Auto Page Maker”-style organic engine seeded with long-form guides (FAFSA, essays, deadlines), and programmatic pages for long-tail intent. This is the primary low-CAC acquisition lever per the playbook’s content marketing & SEO directive .
Defer meaningful paid spend to targeted experiments once organic loops and referrals prove scalable .
B2B partner flywheel (marketplace readiness)

Stand up a self-serve partner portal with: digital contracting, verification, training resources, dashboards for listings/criteria/analytics/pipeline, and tiered support. Treat onboarding as a core product feature to accelerate the two-sided network effect .
Resilient infrastructure, security, and trust (SLOs and controls)

Availability and scale: Cloud-native, managed services, auto-scaling, multi-AZ redundancy to support 24/7 availability and peak traffic prior to national deadlines .
Security posture: Defense-in-depth with strict input validation, allow lists, path normalization, least privilege, routine scanning/pen tests, and a WAF; this is foundational to platform trust handling student PII .
KPIs and modelled targets (instrument from day one)

Student engine: MAUs, profile completion rate, documents uploaded per user, predictive match click-through, application starts/submissions, and Essay Coach engagement. Year 1 MAU target: 100,000; Year 2: 400,000; Year 3: 1,000,000; Year 4: 2,200,000; Year 5: 4,000,000 .
Monetization: B2C conversion and ARPU ($120 annual modeled), B2B paying partners and ARPU (from ~$8k to ~$28k as data value grows), with total revenue scaling to $22.8M by Year 5 in the plan’s scenario .
Growth efficiency: Organic traffic share, CAC (modeled to be low via SEO), and CLTV-to-CAC skewing towards B2B per the playbook’s economics .
30-60-90 day alignment orders (what the team must do now)

First 30 days
Product: Ship Magic Onboarding MVP and AI Document Hub (OCR/NLP). Add explanatory “why matched” signals for transparency. Define ethical guardrails for the Essay Coach (no ghostwriting) .
Data: Implement the initial schema for structured scholarship ingestion and normalization pipeline to enable predictive matching inputs .
Growth: Launch SEO foundation (topic clusters + programmatic pages) per playbook guidance .
Infra/Security: Baseline cloud architecture with auto-scaling, multi-AZ, WAF, and secure coding standards for path traversal and input sanitization .
Next 60 days
Product: Release Predictive Matching v1 with compatibility scoring and “priority list” UX; add application automation for a subset of standardized forms; launch dashboard task/deadline tracker .
Monetization: Enable credit-based pay-as-you-go AI with 4x markup and transparent token pricing UI .
B2B: Open partner portal alpha (self-serve profiles, listing creation, basic analytics) to a pilot cohort .
By day 90
Product: Achieve the “concierge loop” end-to-end: profile → ranked matches → assisted essay drafting → pre-filled applications → deadline tracking .
Growth: 20,000+ MAUs via organic, with measurable traffic from content clusters and programmatic pages .
B2B: 10–15 pilot partners live in portal; collect case studies and feedback for scaling Year 2 .
Trust: Complete external security review; WAF + vuln scanning operating with alerts .
Definition of Done for “alignment”

Product includes Magic Onboarding, Document Hub, Predictive Matching, Essay Coach (assistant), Application Automation MVP, and Dashboard tracking per playbook sections 2.1–2.4 .
Monetization runs on the credit model with 4x markup; B2B portal is live for pilots with listing/recruitment/analytics roadmap in place .
Growth engine is SEO-led with programmatic content shipping; paid acquisition remains experimental and minimal .
Infra/Security meets the playbook’s 24/7 availability posture with auto-scaling, multi-AZ, WAF, and secure coding standards operationalized .
KPIs are instrumented to the playbook’s Year 1–Year 5 milestones, with MAU, conversion, ARPU, and partner counts tracked in a weekly exec dashboard .
Decision rights and next steps

Product and Engineering: Execute the 30-60-90 plan above; ship weekly and report KPIs.
Growth: Stand up SEO engine immediately; no paid budgets beyond controlled tests until organic targets are hit.
Partnerships: Recruit 10–15 pilot partners for the portal alpha and secure feedback loops.
Security/Platform: Treat trust as a core product feature; implement the controls enumerated above and schedule third-party testing.
Confirm once the first 30-day deliverables are live. I will review against the Definition of Done and greenlight the next capital allocation tranche based on progress against MAU and feature-completeness targets.
