Acknowledged. Phase 3 is approved and prioritized. Thank you for the thorough handoff. This execution aligns with our defense-in-depth mandate and 24/7 availability commitments, where security is treated as a core product feature and enforced at the edge via WAF controls, not only in the app tier  .

Executive directives and approvals

Change window: Proceed with the T+0 to T+4h schedule you outlined. Freeze non-emergency application deploys during cutover.
Authority: Infra Lead has go/no‑go authority during the change window. Security Lead has final say on WAF mode transitions and JWT key rollover timing. SRE owns rollback execution if criteria are met.
Budget: Approved to incur incremental Cloudflare charges required for WAF, Bot Management, Rate Limiting, and Logs for 30 days. Finance to tag and track incremental edge spend vs. avoided risk costs.
External platform escalation: Open and maintain Replit P0 per template; escalate to duty manager if no acknowledgment in 2 hours and request platform-level cache purge and RCA. Maintain daily exec updates until mitigation ETA is confirmed.
Go/No‑Go and rollback criteria

Go from Log → Block: After ≥30 minutes in Log mode with zero false positives in the verification matrix across 5 regions and no material latency regression, flip to Block.
Rollback DNS cutover if any of the following exceed 10 consecutive minutes after Block: HTTP 5xx rate >1%, P95 latency >200 ms, auth failures >0.5% above baseline, or verified false-positive WAF blocks impacting student flows.
HSTS caution: Send the HSTS header with preload directive in staging only. Do not submit the domain to the browser preload list until we have 7 days of stable operations post-cutover to preserve rollback optionality.
Reporting cadence and success metrics

T+1h: Confirm Cloudflare config in Log mode, dashboards live, and baseline metrics captured.
T+2h: Confirm DNS cutover to api.scholarshipai.com, WAF in Block mode, and verification matrix pass from 5 regions.
T+4h: Share a summary with metrics and evidence. Continue hourly checks for the first 12 hours, then every 4 hours until EOD.
KPIs to track and report:
Edge: WAF hit rate, false-positive rate on production paths, Bot Management detections, rate-limit triggers, and edge error rate.
Performance: P95 latency and availability vs. SLO (99.9% uptime target remains non‑negotiable) .
Auth: During JWT rotation #2, auth success rate, token refresh success rate, and anomaly alerts on login endpoints.
Evidence: Include Cloudflare logs excerpts, before/after latency graphs, and the completed verification matrix.
Risk controls and contingencies

Platform-layer issue: We accept your assessment that the residual endpoint is at the platform/proxy layer. Cloudflare edge mitigation is the correct containment now, consistent with our WAF-at-edge architecture .
If Replit does not provide a mitigation ETA within 24 hours, maintain the edge block and escalate. If unresolved within 3 business days, prepare a migration plan off the affected proxy path(s) toward our long-term multi‑AZ cloud architecture per Section 5.1 (scalable, managed services, automatic failover) and bring me a timeline and resourcing plan for approval .
Compliance posture: Ensure all changes preserve our privacy and compliance controls and auditability; these safeguards underpin enterprise trust and future SOC 2 milestones (targeted in Year 3) .
What I need from the team

Immediate: Confirm T+0 start, owners on bridge, and monitoring links.
Within 4 hours:
DNS cutover completed and all matrix tests blocked at edge.
WAF mode: Block confirmed with zero critical false positives.
Initial metrics packet: p95 latency, error rate, WAF block counts, bot detections.
Within 24 hours:
Replit P0 acknowledgment with mitigation ETA and agreed actions.
JWT rotation #2 completed or in progress; report auth stability and any user impact.
Statement of “24-hour sustained containment” status.
Any exception that threatens availability or student experience must be escalated immediately. Remember: Trust and uptime are core product features and strategic differentiators for our B2B pipeline and brand .
Decision

Proceed per plan. This action is fully aligned with our security-by-design posture and our roadmap to market leadership, where reliability and responsible security are prerequisites for scaling B2B revenue and institutional partnerships .
I’m on standby for stage-gate updates:

✅ DNS cutover completed and all matrix tests blocked
✅ Replit acknowledges P0 with mitigation ETA
✅ JWT rotation #2 completes with clean metrics
If you need executive air cover with Cloudflare or Replit, loop me in and I’ll engage directly.
