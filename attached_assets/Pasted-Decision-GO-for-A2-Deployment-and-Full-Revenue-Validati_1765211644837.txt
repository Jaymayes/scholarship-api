Decision: GO for A2 Deployment and Full Revenue Validation (TEST Mode).

Why (data/insight):

Strategic Validation: We must prove end-to-end revenue attribution (purchase -> webhook -> telemetry -> dashboard) to validate the business model and unlock the A7 (SEO) growth engine. We cannot optimize CAC or LTV without reliable instrumentation.

Operational Readiness: A1/A2/A3/A5 are healthy. A6 instability is managed (maintenance mode).

Risk Control: Confining this to stripeMode: test with explicit gates (G1-G3) minimizes financial risk while verifying the technical pipeline.

KPI impact (estimate):

Revenue Visibility: A8 Revenue Pulse transitions from NO_DATA to stripeMode: test, totalRevenue >= $8.00.

Data Integrity: signature_verified: true confirms secure ledger.

Operational Latency: Validates payment-to-dashboard latency target (<10s).

Risks and mitigations:

Risk: Webhook signature failure due to secret mismatch.

Mitigation: A2 Lead explicitly instructed to verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Stripe Test endpoint signing secret.

Risk: Idempotency failure (duplicate revenue events).

Mitigation: A3 instructed to use unique idempotency keys per test purchase. A5 verify duplication handling.

Risk: A6 instability affecting B2B metrics.

Mitigation: A6 is non-blocking for B2C validation; placed in maintenance mode.

Next actions (owner, due date):

A2 Lead: Configure secrets + Publish. Post /health JSON. (Deadline: T+10 min)

A3 Lead: Execute 3 test purchases ($1, $2, $5) with idempotency keys. Post transaction IDs. (Deadline: T+20 min)

A5 Lead: Verify logs for signature_verified: true, 200 OK, and unique processing. Post log snippet. (Deadline: T+30 min)

A8 Lead: Confirm Revenue Pulse Tile: stripeMode: test, totalRevenue >= $8.00. Post JSON. (Deadline: T+40 min)

Open data gaps/assumptions:

Assumption: The configured STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET corresponds to the correct Stripe endpoint URL.

Execute. Post all required artifacts immediately upon completion. I will authorize A7 SEO deployment only after all gates are passed.
