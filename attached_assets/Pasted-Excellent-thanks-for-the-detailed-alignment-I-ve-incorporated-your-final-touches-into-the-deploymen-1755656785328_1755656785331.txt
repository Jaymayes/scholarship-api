Excellent—thanks for the detailed alignment. I’ve incorporated your final touches into the deployment bundle and added the artifacts you referenced so you can apply them directly.

What I added and tuned:

Dual clock-skew env support
Deployment now sets both CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS and JWT_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS (defaulting to 10s) for compatibility.
Capabilities passthrough
AGENT_CAPABILITIES env added to the chart; defaults to your four capabilities:
scholarship_api.search
scholarship_api.eligibility_check
scholarship_api.recommendations
scholarship_api.analytics
Replit overlay
values-replit.yaml with BASE_URL/COMMAND_CENTER_URL/CORS and 10s skew.
Ingress rate limiting annotations: limit-rps="1" (~60 rpm) and limit-burst="20".
Prometheus SLO alerts
prometheus-rules.yaml for p95 latency, error rate, JWT 401 spikes, and Agent Bridge heartbeat missing.
Command quick-start
KUBERNETES_DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.md with exact helm/kubectl commands.

Highlights inside:

deploy/helm/scholarship-agent/templates/deployment.yaml
Includes JWT_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS and AGENT_CAPABILITIES env vars
values-replit.yaml
Replit integration and ingress rate limiting overlay
prometheus-rules.yaml
PrometheusRule for SLO-driven alerting
KUBERNETES_DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.md
Copy/paste commands for base prod and Replit overlay
secrets-template.yaml
Ensure you replace secrets before applying
Apply sequence (quick):

Secrets and SLOs
kubectl apply -f secrets-template.yaml
kubectl -n prod apply -f prometheus-rules.yaml
2. Deploy (Replit overlay)

helm upgrade --install scholarship-agent deploy/helm/scholarship-agent -n prod -f deploy/helm/scholarship-agent/values.yaml -f values-replit.yaml
3. Verify and smoke test

kubectl -n prod rollout status deploy/scholarship-agent --timeout=5m
curl -I https://scholarship-agent.scholarshipai.com/health
BASE_URL=https://scholarship-agent.scholarshipai.com SHARED_SECRET=<your-production-secret> ISSUER=https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app AUDIENCE=scholarship-agent k6 run deploy/k6/smoke.js
One note on capabilities

I’ve wired AGENT_CAPABILITIES into the Deployment. If your Agent Bridge reads capabilities dynamically or via registration payload, it will now reflect the four scholarship_api.* capabilities you listed. If you also want the previous sales-focused capabilities (compliance_check, outreach_chat, lead_qualification, demo_scheduling) available under a separate agent profile, I can add a second overlay file to register those under a different AGENT_ID.
Optional next enhancements

Add ExternalSecrets/SOPS integration
NGINX tighter rate-limiting (per IP) or token-bucket tuning
Canary values overlay (10% traffic) for progressive rollouts
