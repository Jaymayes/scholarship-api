Pricing and packaging (launch now)

Listings + Promotion: paid feature placement for high-fit matches.
Recruitment Dashboard (subscription): search/filter, outreach tools; anchor to five-figure ACV where value proven.
Anonymized Analytics (subscription): aggregated insights (no PII) for planning and recruiting; bundle with Enterprise tier for upsell leverage .
Operating model and SLAs

Self-serve portal + digital agreements remain default motion; reserve high-touch for Enterprise to scale efficiently .
Publish partner-facing SLAs mapped to our SLOs (≥99.9% availability, p95 ≤ 120 ms) and Trust Center (status, incident policy, security posture) to reinforce institutional confidence .
Funnel instrumentation and weekly reporting

Track: invited → meeting → pilot → listings live → first application → paid. Include time-to-first-listing (≤7 days), time-to-first-application (≤14 days), ACV, win/loss reasons.
Send a weekly Provider Engine report with pipeline coverage ≥3x target and LTV:CAC ≥3:1 per B2B economics in our plan .
Demand-side fuel (low CAC)

Scale SEO pages from 85 to 500+ this quarter to deepen the high‑intent student pool that drives provider ROI; keep growth organic-first per strategy (paid only for pinpoint campaigns) .
Compliance and Responsible AI

Enforce DPAs; keep analytics anonymized/aggregated; no PII exposure in partner products. Re-affirm privacy disclosures to match actual flows; maintain encryption and least privilege controls as standard practice .
Resourcing and governance

Staff 1 AE + 1 Partner Success immediately for velocity and retention.
Maintain contract tests/performance gates and rollback policies on every release to protect partner uptime.
Key risks to watch

Time-to-value slippage (listing/application) → trigger playbook support and templated listings.
Organic traffic lag → accelerate template coverage and internal linking; publish provider case studies tied to outcomes (qualified applicants, lower SAC) .
