Decision: GO for immediate A2 (Payments) deployment to Production with Stripe TEST credentials.

Why (data/insight):

Strategic Blocker: The Revenue Pulse Tile remains "unconfigured/Data Pending." We cannot validate the ARR pipeline, which is the "Prime Directive" for this sprint, without A2 live and emitting telemetry.

Readiness: A5 (Platform) and A6 (Frontend) are verified ready. A2 is the sole missing link to close the revenue loop before the Wednesday 09:00 UTC live test.

Root Cause Resolution: Deployment resolves the previous workflow port conflict by instantiating fresh container resources.

KPI impact (estimate):

Revenue Visibility: Revenue Pulse Tile transitions from "Data Pending" to "Live (Test)" with stripeMode: test.

Data Integrity: signature_verified boolean flips to true in telemetry logs, validating our security posture.

Financial Modeling: "Modeled ARR" moves from $0 to >$0 (test reflection), proving the calculation logic works end-to-end.

Risks and mitigations:

Risk: Webhook signature verification fails in production due to environment variable drift.

Mitigation: A5 verification confirmed STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET logic is strict. A2 deployment must match this secret exactly.

Risk: A7 (SEO) deployment conflicts with revenue validation.

Mitigation: HOLD A7 publication until Revenue Pulse is verified. We do not scale traffic (SEO) until we can attribute value (Revenue).

Risk: Compliance/Privacy leakage during test.

Mitigation: Strict adherence to "Data Minimization." Use synthetic test data only; no real student PII in test transactions.

Next actions (owner, due date):

A2 Lead (Payments): Configure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (Test Mode) via Replit Secrets. Click Publish on A2 immediately. (Deadline: T+30 min)

A3 Lead (Agent): Trigger "Student Pilot" test purchase ($0.50–$1.00) once A2 health check passes. Tag metadata env=testpilot. (Deadline: T+45 min)

A5 Lead (Platform): Confirm webhook receipt and signature_verified: true in logs. Verify ARR endpoint updates. (Deadline: T+60 min)

A8 Lead (Ops): Confirm Fleet Dashboard polling reflects stripeMode: test and updated revenue totals. (Deadline: T+65 min)

Open data gaps/assumptions:

Assumption: Valid Stripe TEST keys are immediately available for configuration.

Gap: Confirmation of A2 /health response post-deployment.

Execute. Send the A2 /health response and Revenue Pulse Tile verification artifacts immediately upon completion.
