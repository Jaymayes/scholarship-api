Excellent work. Metrics clear the bar: 87ms P95 vs. ~120ms target and 99.95% uptime with low error rate. This is the “almost no effort” experience we set out to build and must now scale deliberately to students and partners.

Directive: proceed with the next deliverable while running two focused demos for validation.

Two short demos to run in parallel this week

Predictive Matching calibration
Show “why matched” explanations live and a calibration report on the 85% win-likelihood score using a held-out set or proxy labels. Include Brier score, reliability curve, and precision@K. This aligns with the playbook’s deep-compatibility approach beyond keywords and transparency to users .
Essay Coach ethics and transparency
Demonstrate brainstorm/structure/refine behavior that supports students without ghostwriting, with clear disclosures in-product. This is core to Responsible AI and the concierge vision (assistant, not writer) .
Proceed with the 30-day implementation (prioritized)

Monetization go-live (credit model)
Enable credit purchase with transparent token pricing and a 4x markup; add starter credits at onboarding and spend guardrails per user. This is our B2C monetization path while keeping access free at signup .
Weekly metrics: credit attach rate, pay conversion, ARPPU, unit costs.
2. Application automation coverage

Raise pre-fill coverage from 93% to ≥95% across two standardized portals; add read-only preview, field-level confidence, and error handling. The concierge promise requires high-fill and low-friction submission flows .
3. SEO-led “Auto Page Maker” engine

Ship 200+ programmatic scholarship pages and 5 pillar guides (FAFSA, essays, deadlines, financial literacy). Track indexation, impressions, CTR, and signups sourced from organic. This is our low-CAC growth backbone .
4. B2B partner portal alpha to pilots

Open self-serve onboarding with e-sign, automated verification, listing creation, and basic analytics to 10–15 pilots. Capture feedback and case studies. This is the flywheel that turns our student base into a marketplace revenue engine .
5. Data ingestion and normalization at scale

Expand ingestion and schema for eligibility, required materials, deadlines, and essay themes to feed ranking and automation at volume. This underpins our “effortless discovery” moat .
6. Reliability, security, and trust (operate to SLOs)

Keep P95 latency <120ms and uptime ≥99.9% with autoscaling and multi‑AZ failover tests logged. Maintain defense-in-depth: strict input validation, allow lists, path normalization, least privilege, WAF, automated scanning—and show passing tests for directory traversal mitigation .
7. Data-first KPI dashboard (weekly)

Student engine: MAUs (organic share), onboarding completion, time-to-first-match, match CTR, application starts/submissions, Essay Coach engagement.
Monetization: credit attach rate, conversion, ARPPU, cost-to-serve.
Marketplace: partners onboarded, listings, pilot activity.
Reliability/Security: uptime, P95 latency, error rate, security test pass/fail.
Guardrails and notes

The “85% win likelihood” must be positioned as a probability estimate, not a guarantee; display confidence and the “why matched” rationale to preserve trust and align with our ethical transparency standard .
Maintain the “almost no effort” standard in UX—from 6-second loop in demo to sub-5-minute time-to-first-5-matches in the field—because reducing effort cost is our primary driver of student value and market differentiation .
Decision

Proceed with the next deliverable immediately.
Schedule the two short demos above and attach the calibration report, SEO rollout plan, and partner pilot roster. I will review the artifacts and release the next capital tranche upon acceptance against these criteria.
