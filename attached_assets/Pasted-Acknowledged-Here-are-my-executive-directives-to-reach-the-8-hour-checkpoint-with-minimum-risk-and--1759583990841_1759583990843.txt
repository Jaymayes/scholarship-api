Acknowledged. Here are my executive directives to reach the 8-hour checkpoint with minimum risk and maximum signal.

Executive stance

Conditional launch remains in effect. Payments will default to feature-flagged OFF unless fully configured and validated before the gate.
Essay assistance remains disabled until AI Ethics guardrails are approved. No exceptions.
SEO and Auth are the critical path. WAF/auth must be green first.
Immediate directives and acceptance criteria

Security Lead + Backend Lead (WAF/auth) — due T+3h
Action: Add a temporary, least-privilege WAF bypass for auth endpoints only (e.g., POST /auth/, /oauth/), retaining IP reputation, rate limits, and bot checks. Do not weaken protections for non-auth endpoints.
Tests: Run negative tests (SQLi/XSS), then a 30-minute auth soak test.
Acceptance: 0 WAF false positives on auth endpoints; auth success ≥99.5%; no material increase in blocked attacks on non-auth traffic.
2. QA Lead (13 auth-dependent tests) — start immediately after WAF patch; due T+4h

Action: Execute all 13 tests. Provide an evidence bundle (commands, responses, screenshots).
Acceptance: 100% pass. If any fail, open P0 tickets and re-run within the window.
3. SEO Lead (robots.txt + sitemap.xml) — due T+2h

Action: Publish robots.txt that allows site-wide crawl except admin paths, and references sitemap. Publish sitemap.xml including core pages plus Auto Page Maker index and canonical rules.
Validation: curl checks + Search Console readiness verified.
Acceptance: Live, reachable, and valid (no errors in simple validators).
4. Payments Engineer + DevOps (Stripe) — decision point T+5h; final status by T+6h

Default: payments_enabled=false in prod until validated.
If proceeding: configure secrets, run $0.50 test charge, verify webhook and credit grant, and confirm UI states for success/failure.
Acceptance to turn ON: 3 successful end-to-end test charges, 0 webhook drops, correct credit issuance, and refund path verified. If not met by T+6h, remain OFF and hide purchase CTAs.
5. SRE Lead (Observability) — due T+3h

Dashboards: Auth success rate (overall and by endpoint), WAF triggers by rule/endpoint, P95 latency, error rate, funnel metrics.
Alerts: Auth success <99.5% for 5 min; P95 >120ms for 10 min; error rate ≥1% for 5 min; spike in WAF false positives.
Acceptance: All dashboards live; alerts firing in test; on-call rota confirmed.
6. Platform Lead (Rate limiting plan) — prep now, implement Week 1

Action: Confirm design for centralized Redis rate limiting (keys, limits, burst, penalties), with a plan to protect auth, search, and application submission endpoints first.
Output: 1-page plan and rollout steps.
7. SRE Lead (Rollback) — staging drill today; Week 1 prod drill

Action: 15-minute staging rollback rehearsal now; document steps, RTO, and owners.
Acceptance: RTO ≤10 minutes in staging; issues captured with owners.
8. Head of AI Ethics (Guardrails) — 48-hour SLA

Action: Policy + enforcement for essay assistance. Until approved, block essay generation features; allow only brainstorming/templates that avoid academic dishonesty.
Acceptance: Documented policy, test suite, red-team findings, enforcement in place.
Go/No-Go checkpoint (T+8h)
All gates must be GREEN:

Auth: ≥99.5% login success; 0 WAF false positives on auth endpoints
13 tests: 100% pass with evidence bundle
SEO: robots.txt + sitemap.xml live and validated
Observability: dashboards and alerts active and tested
Payments: Stripe fully validated OR feature-flagged OFF with correct UI state
SLO confidence: P95 ≤120ms; error rate <1%
Cadence and comms

Checkpoints: T+2h (WAF/SEO status), T+5h (Stripe decision), T+8h (Go/No-Go).
Escalation: Any RED for auth/WAF triggers immediate exec review and holds the launch.
Single source of truth: Update the Pre-Launch Readiness Report V2 with live statuses, links to dashboards, and test evidence.
Your immediate tasks (standing by role)

SEO: If not already in progress, generate robots.txt and sitemap.xml placeholders now for the SEO Lead to review and deploy.
QA: Prepare the automated test run so it can start the moment the WAF patch lands; have the reporting template ready.
Observability: Partner with SRE to validate alert firing via synthetic triggers and capture screenshots for the report.
Please confirm:

The default feature flag for payments is set to OFF in prod.
The auth WAF patch ETA and the exact auth endpoints to be exempted.
The domain(s) to reference in robots.txt and sitemap.xml.
The scheduled times for T+2h, T+5h, and T+8h check-ins and the DRI for each.
