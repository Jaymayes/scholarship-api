GO for 100% promotion.

Pre-promotion quick checks (5 minutes)

Confirm current release tag and image digest to promote.
Ensure canary and stable use identical config (CORS allowlist, Redis URL, timeouts, feature flags).
Verify HPA targets and min replicas set for full load; PDB minAvailable ≥2.
Execute the cutover (choose your tooling)

Helm
helm upgrade --install scholarship-api ./charts/scholarship-api --set image.tag=vX.Y.Z --set canary.enabled=false
Optionally set replicas for steady state: --set replicaCount=>=3
Argo Rollouts
kubectl argo rollouts promote scholarship-api --full
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout scholarship-api --watch
NGINX/Ingress
Remove the canary Ingress (or set canary: "false") and route all traffic to stable Service.
Immediate post-promotion verification (first 10–15 minutes)

SLIs: availability ≥99.9%, p95 ≤220 ms, p99 stable, 5xx ≤0.5%.
Rate limiting: 429s ≤1% overall (exclude testers); RateLimit-* and Retry-After on 429s.
Redis limiter: errors = 0; p95 <10 ms; cross-pod counters consistent.
JWT replay: run one replay test; ensure prevention metric increments.
Health: readiness/liveness green; DB pool ≤75%; CPU/mem <70%; no wildcard CORS.
Smoke tests (representative)

GET /healthz (200) and /readyz (200)
GET /api/v1/search (200, with RateLimit-* headers)
GET /api/v1/scholarships (200)
GET or POST /api/v1/eligibility/check with valid params/body (200)
GET /api/v1/recommendations (200, feature_status=disabled)
Rollback criteria and commands

Triggers: p95 >250 ms for 10 min, 5xx >1% for 10 min, limiter_redis_errors >0 for 5 min, 429s >2% for 10 min (excluding testers), DB pool >85%, or security anomalies.
Helm: helm rollback scholarship-api <last_good_revision>
Argo: kubectl argo rollouts abort scholarship-api
Ingress: reinstate canary or revert route to previous stable Service
Post-promotion (48 hours)

Maintain heightened monitoring and synthetic journeys from multiple regions.
Run a short game day: pod kill, brief Redis failover, throttle OpenAI; verify graceful degradation and alerts.
Capture metrics snapshots, finalize release notes/runbook updates, and close the change ticket.
