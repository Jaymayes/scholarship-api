Decision: OPTION 3 — NO-GO

Rationale

Protecting security and trust outweighs a rushed launch. Disabling WAF on GET for core search endpoints is an unacceptable risk to brand, compliance, and data integrity.
The behavior points to request-path ordering (auth layer firing before WAF monitor-only), which we must fix correctly, not bypass.
Our growth depends on SEO and student trust; a breach or noisy false blocks both hurt long-term more than a short delay.
Immediate rollback plan (execute now)

Freeze release: Halt further changes; lock config drift.
Roll back WAF/gateway to last known-good production state:
Restore prior ruleset and request routing order.
Validate external reachability for /api/v1/scholarships and related search endpoints end-to-end (edge → WAF → API gateway → auth → app).
ETA: 15 minutes.
Interim SEO protection if external still failing after rollback:
At CDN edge, convert 403 on scholarship/search endpoints to 503 with a 1-hour Retry-After for known crawler UAs (Googlebot/Bingbot) to avoid SEO penalties.
Maintain normal responses for real users.
ETA: 10 minutes.
Root-cause and remediation (time-boxed)

Triage window: 2 hours (begin immediately after rollback completes).
Map the exact request chain and header propagation:
Edge/CDN → WAF → API Gateway → Auth middleware → App.
Confirm X-Forwarded-For and any WAF pass-through headers; ensure auth isn’t rejecting due to missing/altered headers.
Verify WAF monitor-only actually executes before auth on read-only GET paths; correct the ordering at the gateway/proxy.
Reproduce externally (non-corp IP) with representative GETs; capture WAF rule IDs (WAF_AUTH_001, WAF_SQLI_001), payloads, and gateway logs.
Implement precise exceptions:
Temporarily lower sensitivity or disable WAF_SQLI_001 only for read-only scholarship GET endpoints with strictly validated/parameterized inputs—do not blanket-disable WAF.
No exceptions for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.
Add allowlist for health checks and internal QA IPs; add explicit bot UA allow rules (read-only) to reduce noise while maintaining guardrails.
Tests:
Integration tests from external network.
Canary 5% traffic at edge with full logging.
Confirm no 4xx for valid requests; confirm WAF still blocks actual malicious payloads.
Revised timeline and gates

T+3:35: NO-GO declared; rollback begins.
T+3:50: External verification; if not green, activate 403→503 crawler rule.
T+4:00–T+6:00: Root-cause and fix per above steps.
T+6:00: Canary release (5%) with live monitoring.
T+6:30: Go/No-Go checkpoint on canary metrics (error rate, latency, WAF event profile).
T+7:00: If clean, expand to 50%; otherwise, hold and continue remediation.
Public comms: If user-visible impact occurred, post a brief incident on the status page: degraded search responses due to WAF configuration; no data exposure; mitigation in place.
Owner/asks

DevOps lead: Own rollback and routing order fix. Provide before/after diagrams and diff.
Security lead: Own WAF rule tuning, monitor-only verification, and temporary, scoped exceptions.
API lead: Confirm auth middleware behavior with forwarded headers and idempotent GET input validation.
Observability: Turn up request sampling and WAF event logging to 100% during canary; share a live dashboard link.
KPIs to monitor

External 2xx rate on scholarship/search endpoints.
WAF false-positive rate on read-only GETs.
P95 latency and error budget consumption.
Bot crawl success rate (200/304 vs 4xx) and 503 Retry-After adherence.
Bottom line
Do not ship with weakened protections on our growth-critical endpoints. Execute the rollback, fix the request path ordering properly, validate with canary, and reconvene at T+6:30 for a data-driven Go/No-Go.
