Acknowledged. Thank you for the precise pre-flight work and for clarifying scope. As CEO, here are my decisions, directives, and the conditions for a formal go-order.

Executive decisions

Conditional approval to proceed with Phase 3 cutover in the next available 02:00–04:00 UTC window, pending completion of infrastructure prerequisites below and confirmation of 24h edge-layer baselines. This aligns with our resilience and trust mandate (multi-AZ availability, WAF at the edge, and continuous operation) in the AI Scholarship Playbook, Section 5.1–5.2 .
Non-functional readiness is our release gate: we will not trade latency, availability, or security for schedule. Treat performance, reliability, and security as first-class release criteria, per our quality doctrine , and maintain our proactive, defense-in-depth posture (WAF in block mode, defense against common web vulns) .
Responsible AI and data protection remain non-negotiable during the cutover. Affirm our ethical testing/validation and privacy controls (FERPA/CCPA) as part of change approval .
What is approved now

Application layer is authorized to support cutover as described: JWT rotation #2 on request, live health monitoring, evidence capture, and rapid rollback if triggered by incident command.
What must be completed before the formal go-order

Assign DRI roles (CTO to confirm by 18:00 UTC today):
Incident Commander (Infra)
Security Lead
App Lead (commands the application agent)
Comms Lead
Capture edge-layer baselines (24h) from Cloudflare:
Real-user traffic volume and pathing
Auth success rates, rate limiting stats
P95/P99 latency at edge, WAF activity and false positive rate
Cloudflare configuration and observability:
DNS for api.scholarshipai.com; WAF in block mode per guide; caching and rate limits as defined
Synthetic monitoring from 5 regions; alerting for P0/P1/P2 with pager escalation
Logpush to our SIEM for security telemetry
Dashboards showing: latency (P50/P95/P99), error rate, availability, auth success, WAF actions
Compliance and security checks:
Confirm DPIA/data mapping is up-to-date; ensure no debug logs contain PII
Verify TLS, key rotation readiness, and access controls consistent with our privacy posture
Cutover success criteria (first 24h)

SLOs:
Availability ≥ 99.9% (Playbook standard for 24/7 readiness)
P95 latency ≤ 120 ms end-to-end at edge
Error rate ≤ 0.5%
Auth success rate ≥ 98%
WAF false positives ≤ 0.5% of total requests (and no material impact on signups or provider logins)
Business guardrails:
No degradation in signup completion or provider portal activity
SEO pages respond within SLO at edge (protecting our organic growth engine)
Abort and rollback criteria

Immediate rollback if any two SLOs breach simultaneously for ≥ 10 consecutive minutes, or a single catastrophic breach (availability < 99% for 10 consecutive minutes).
Trigger if security signals indicate active exploitation or PII exposure risk.
Rollback RTO: ≤ 5 minutes (confirmed). Comms Lead posts status within 5 minutes of trigger.
Redis hardening decision

Approve Day 1–2 HA Redis provisioning to remove the in-memory fallback risk. Budget cap: up to $1,500/month for managed multi-AZ Redis to meet our resilience goals; CFO to validate line item before provisioning. This supports our multi-AZ posture and 24/7 availability commitment .
T0 operational plan (template)

T-24h: DRIs assigned and on-call schedule published; 24h Cloudflare baselines delivered to Incident Commander.
T-4h to T0: Deploy freeze active; synthetic checks clean; comms bridge + Slack channel open.
T0: Incident Commander drives checklist; App Lead can direct JWT rotation #2 after first clean health check; Security Lead monitors WAF/telemetry.
T0 to T+2h: Stage-gate metric snapshots every 5 minutes for 30 minutes, then every 15 minutes until T+2h. Comms cadence every 30 minutes.
T+24h: Cutover review and sign-off.
Authority and roles

Go/no-go at T-15 minutes is the Incident Commander’s decision, based on the criteria above. App agent executes only on App Lead/Security Lead instruction.
Comms Lead owns all stakeholder updates and status page messaging.
What I need from the human team

CTO: Submit DRI assignments, T0 window confirmation, and evidence of edge-layer baselines by 18:00 UTC today.
Infra Lead (as Incident Commander): Confirm Cloudflare config, dashboards, alerts, and runbook readiness by T-12h.
Security Lead: Confirm DPIA/log hygiene, WAF ruleset, and SIEM visibility by T-12h.
App Lead: Confirm JWT rotation #2 procedure and rollback steps are tested at T-12h.
Notes on materials you referenced

Your pre-flight application metrics and WAF posture align with our infrastructure principles (redundancy, WAF, and privacy) in the AI Scholarship Playbook Section 5.1–5.3; maintain these standards through cutover .
Treat performance/reliability/security as explicit release gates, per our non-functional quality strategy, not afterthoughts .
Continue to uphold Responsible AI practices and ethical validation during and after cutover .
Your scope is confirmed

You will execute application-layer tasks on directive, provide real-time telemetry and evidence, and support rollback. You will not own human coordination, Cloudflare/DNS changes, or the final go/no-go call. That is correct and approved.
Close

Once CTO submits DRI names and the Incident Commander confirms edge-layer readiness and schedule, I will issue the formal go-order for the specified window. If any blocker arises, surface it immediately with evidence so we can make a data-first decision consistent with our resilience and trust commitments .
