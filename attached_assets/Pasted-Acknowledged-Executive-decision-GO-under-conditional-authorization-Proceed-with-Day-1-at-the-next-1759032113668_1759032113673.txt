Acknowledged. Executive decision: GO under conditional authorization. Proceed with Day 1 at the next window (08:00–18:00 UTC tomorrow). Maintain “GO unless red gate triggers,” with the auto-advance and rollback rules below.

What to do before 08:00 UTC (by 07:30 UTC)

Final preflight: confirm Day 2 criteria monitors are green, error budget burn ≤10% rolling 30 days, security scans clean, backup/restore verification timestamp <24h.
Canary playbook drill: run a 10-minute dry-run of rollback + traffic pinning in staging with production configs to validate operator muscle memory and alerting routes.
Communications: prep provider-facing status note and public status page banner (informational only; no material customer impact expected).
Cost-control canary: arm kill-switch with hard cap at 15% over baseline/forecast for the canary slice; verify automated request-throttling and model downgrades engage within 60 seconds.
Authorized canary plan (re-affirmed)

Traffic ramp: 5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% (60-minute soak each).
Geography: US-first; expand globally at 25% if all gates green.
Paid acquisition: remain blocked during soak; organic only.
Emergency rollback: immediate on any red gate; change freeze enforced in window.
Red gates (immediate rollback)

Reliability: availability <99.9% for any 15-min window OR P95 latency >120ms for 2 consecutive 15-min windows OR error budget burn >10% for the release day.
Security/Compliance: any critical/high finding; audit coverage for PII <99%.
Data integrity: any data loss signal; shadow consistency <99.9% for 2 consecutive intervals; backup restore test failure.
SEO safety: >1% soft-404s or CWV regressions beyond agreed thresholds; indexable pages deviate >±5%.
Provider protection: success rate <99.5% OR P95 >150ms for certified endpoints; any failed contract test in production.
Cost: >15% infra/model spend vs forecast for the canary slice for >5 minutes after auto-throttle/model-stepdown.
Amber gates (hold at current ramp; investigate within window)

Error budget burn 9–10% (day) or rising >0.5% per hour.
Provider latency trending toward 150ms P95; success rate 99.5–99.7%.
SEO crawl budget pressure: indexation dips below 97% or crawl stats show >20% spikes on thin-content candidates (even if noindex is working).
DB early saturation: connection pool >80% sustained or queue depth rising for 2 intervals.
Risk mitigations to have active during soak

Provider API latency: circuit breakers + jittered retries; per-provider bulkheads; cache pre-warming for top-20 providers; proactive comms to top-10 to expect minor variance.
SEO crawl budget: keep auto-noindex on; cap new pages at current rate until post-soak; enforce CWV budgets; adaptive sitemap partitioning to guide crawlers.
DB saturation: enforce connection pooling, backpressure, and read-replica routing for heavy reads; autoscale thresholds pre-tuned; slow-query sampling at 1% during ramp.
Cost anomaly drill

Treat the +7900% simulated overspend as a must-pass chaos test. During the 5% canary, inject a synthetic spend spike to verify:
Alert fired <60s, throttle engaged, model tier stepdown executed, and spend returns to baseline <5 minutes.
Log the sequence with timestamps for audit.
KPI expectations during and post-soak

Primary experience KPI (Time-to-First-Reward): maintain ≤3.0m (current 1.8m; stretch ≤1.6m by end of ramp).
Conversion: hold ≥3.2% free→paid; accept temporary ±0.3% variance during ramp if TTF-Reward improves.
Provider: maintain ≥99.8% API success; no degradation to settlement or reporting paths.
Reporting cadence

08:00 UTC: GO ping with preflight summary.
Each ramp step end: 15-min checkpoint report covering reliability, security, cost, SEO, provider, and TTF-Reward.
10:00 UTC dashboard: include incremental revenue lift attributable to treatment (B2C and 3% provider fees), ARPU, CAC (organic only), D1/D7 cohort retention deltas, and SEO non-brand traffic growth.
End of window: rollup with pass/fail against Day 2 criteria; if PASS, authorize automatic Day 3 canary at next window.
Capital allocation and priorities

Maintain 4.2x AI markup; do not relax until we see sustained TTF-Reward ≤1.6m and conversion ≥3.5%.
SEO engine: continue organic expansion; keep quality gates strict. If indexation stays ≥98% and CWV green, propose stepping content velocity +15% next week.
No paid acquisition unlocks until after Day 3 complete and LTV:CAC model refresh confirms >3:1 under organic assumptions.
Default posture

Proceed as configured. If any red gate triggers, rollback immediately and freeze changes. Exec channel paging is authorized for any red-gate breach or sustained amber gate >30 minutes.
You have my authorization to execute per the above. Send the 07:30 UTC preflight and we’ll go from there.
