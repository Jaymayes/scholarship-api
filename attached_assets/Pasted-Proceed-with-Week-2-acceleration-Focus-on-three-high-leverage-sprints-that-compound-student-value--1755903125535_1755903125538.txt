Proceed with Week 2 acceleration. Focus on three high‑leverage sprints that compound student value, organic growth, and B2B readiness per the Playbook.

Week 2 priorities and targets

SEO Auto Page Maker scale (primary low-CAC engine)

Output: Grow from 55 to ≥120 programmatic pages live; raise quality to ≥90%.
Indexation: ≥60% indexed; CTR ≥2%; deliver ≥12k MAUs with ≥50% from organic by end of week.
Tactics: tighten templates, add internal linking hubs, schema.org (Scholarship, FAQPage, Breadcrumb), XML sitemaps, canonical tags, and avoid duplicate/thin pages. This aligns with the Playbook’s mandate to prioritize content marketing and SEO for student acquisition .
Partner Portal activation and time-to-value

Reduce onboarding time from 8.5 minutes to ≤5 minutes by streamlining steps, pre-filling verified org data, and deferring non-critical profile fields.
Targets: reach 10–15 pilots total and ≥50 live listings; capture 3 partner quotes/case studies for proof. This follows the automated, self-serve partner onboarding flywheel we committed to (portal, e‑sign, verification, training, tiered support) .
Application automation and Responsible AI

Raise pre-fill coverage from 93% to ≥95% across two standardized application flows; add read-only preview, field-level confidence, and graceful fallbacks.
Maintain “assistant, not ghostwriter” behavior for the Essay Coach with visible disclosures and “why matched” transparency in ranking. This is core to our concierge promise, automation, and ethics standards in the Playbook .
Monetization and KPI guardrails

Keep the credit model live with transparent token pricing at 4x markup; use contextual prompts at high-intent moments to edge 7‑day attach from 9.2% toward 10–12% while preserving trust and UX. This follows the hybrid B2C credits + B2B marketplace monetization architecture .
Report weekly: MAUs (organic share), time‑to‑first‑match, match CTR, app starts/submissions, credit attach rate, ARPPU, unit cost and gross margin on AI usage, partners onboarded, listings live.
Reliability, security, and compliance

Sustain ≥99.9% uptime and ≤120 ms P95 with autoscaling and multi‑AZ; keep WAF + strict input validation/allow lists/path normalization/least privilege active. Provide evidence of directory traversal test coverage and WAF blocks. These controls underpin our 24/7 availability and trust posture .
Two short demos by end of Week 2

SEO at scale: show 120+ pages live, index coverage, impressions/CTR, and the internal linking map supporting organic capture per the SEO-first strategy .
Partner TTV: live walkthrough from signup to first listing ≤5 minutes, including e‑sign and verification, matching the onboarding flywheel design .
Decision

Approved: accelerate Week 2 on the above focus areas. Maintain your weekly CEO dashboard cadence. I’ll review the two demos and KPI deltas mid‑week; if we’re on track, we’ll unlock the next tranche for content scale, partner activation, and ingestion expansion.
