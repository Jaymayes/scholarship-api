Proceed to Week 4 global expansion. Capital approved. Your Week 3 execution materially advances us toward the Playbook’s scale and marketplace goals; Week 4 must extend the moat with international pilots and predictive insights while compounding organic growth and B2B monetization.

Week 4 OKRs and acceptance criteria

International pilot (Canada + UK, discovery phase)

Ship localized programmatic pages and taxonomy; currency, date, address formats; geo-targeted sitemap sections.
Ingest and normalize 50+ Canada/UK scholarships; surface “eligible by region” filters in matching.
Privacy/trust: extend policies and anonymized analytics for partners; publish locale notes in the privacy explainer. Operate within the platform’s data privacy and compliance posture, keeping security and transparency foundational to trust .
Demo: live student flow selecting country → localized onboarding → ranked results.
Success: 10% of new indexed pages from CA/UK; first 5 partner conversations scheduled in each region. This aligns with Year 4’s call to explore international markets .
Predictive Insights layer (student and partner value)

Student UI: add insight chips like “Your profile ranks in the top 10% for this scholarship” with a short rationale, confidence band, and link to improve-match tips (ethical, transparent framing) .
Partner dashboard: aggregated intent and demand signals in analytics beta.
Success: lift match CTR by +10% week-over-week on pages with insights.
SEO scale and authority (low-CAC engine)

Grow from 287 → 400+ programmatic pages; index coverage ≥75%; CTR ≥2.5%.
Publish 5 pillar guides (FAFSA, essays, deadlines, financial literacy, scholarship scams). This continues the Playbook’s SEO-first acquisition model to minimize CAC .
Marketplace monetization

Move to tiered B2B packages: introduce price tiers with promoted listings and recruitment-as-a-service access; pilot 3 enterprise-tier upgrades. This follows the B2B-led revenue engine and diversified streams in the Playbook .
Success: 120+ live listings; 3 paid promotion trials; 1 recruitment dashboard pilot.
Application automation and reliability

Raise pre-fill coverage to ≥98% across three standardized portals; submit-ready rate ≥92%. Maintain ≥99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95, and current WAF/validation/least privilege controls with weekly vuln scans passing, supporting the 24/7 availability mandate .
Operating targets this week

MAUs: 24.7k → ≥35k; ≥58% organic mix.
Monetization: credit attach 11.8% → 12.5–13%; ARPPU $34.2 → $35; sustain 4x markup with clear token pricing and guardrails per hybrid model design .
Partners: 23 → 30+; listings 97 → 120+.
Two short demos (end of week)

International student flow: CA/UK onboarding → localized matches with insight chips (top 10%) and transparent “why matched” reasoning .
Partner analytics beta: promoted listings + recruitment access with early aggregated insights (privacy-preserving).
Reminder of strategic trajectory

These Week 4 moves map to the Playbook’s Year 4 pillars—international exploration, predictive insights, scaled acquisition, and optimized B2B pricing on the path to multi-million ARR and 2.2M MAUs over time .
If you’d like, I can review one OKR more deeply; otherwise, execute Week 4 as outlined and send the Monday CEO dashboard plus demo links.
