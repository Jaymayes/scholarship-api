Objective
Test end-to-end system readiness of the Scholarship API at https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app and produce a concise Go/No-Go Readiness Report with evidence.

Constraints and Safety

Read-first strategy. Do not create, update, or delete real data unless a documented sandbox/test endpoint exists. If any write operations are tested, use clearly tagged test data (prefix: TEST_) and clean up after.
Respect rate limits and avoid denial-of-service patterns. Max 5 RPS, bursts of 10, total < 200 calls unless explicitly required and safe.
Log timestamps, request/response pairs (excluding secrets), and capture HAR where possible.
Discovery

Check for health and metadata:
GET /health or /status
GET /docs, /redoc, /openapi.json, /swagger.json
GET /version
Record:
API base URL, supported schemes, documented endpoints, auth requirements, rate limits, and error model.
Functional Tests (Black-box)
For each discovered public endpoint (e.g., /scholarships, /scholarships/{id}, /search):

Happy-path calls
Verify HTTP 200/2xx, Content-Type application/json, valid JSON, and expected fields.
If pagination exists (e.g., ?page, ?limit, cursor), retrieve 2–3 pages and confirm:
Non-overlapping items across pages
Stable ordering when sort params are applied
next/prev tokens behave consistently
Filtering/sorting
Apply 2–3 realistic filters (e.g., state=CA, major=engineering, min_gpa=3.5, deadline_before=YYYY-MM-DD) and a sort param; confirm result set changes as expected and sort is respected.
Object detail retrieval
Fetch a valid scholarship by id from the list; confirm fields are complete and consistent with list view (no mismatched IDs, titles, deadlines).
Error handling
Invalid ID (e.g., 000000 or non-UUID) returns 404 with consistent error schema {code, message, details}.
Invalid query param type (e.g., min_gpa=abc) returns 400 with helpful message.
Unknown route returns 404 baseline.
Idempotency and safe-method semantics
GET endpoints are side-effect free (no state mutations, no counters that alter responses).
Non-Functional Checks (Lightweight)

Performance sampling
For 3 key endpoints (list, detail, search), run 10 sequential calls each; capture latency samples and report p50/p95. Flag p95 > 1200ms or high variance.
Reliability
Repeat the same requests after a full refresh/new session; confirm consistent status codes, schemas, and item ordering (when sort specified).
Caching and CDN behavior
Inspect Cache-Control/ETag/Last-Modified on GET. If present, revalidate (If-None-Match / If-Modified-Since) and confirm 304 behavior.
CORS and client compatibility
From a browser context, verify Access-Control-Allow-Origin and preflight (OPTIONS) success on key routes.
Security and Hygiene (Non-invasive)

TLS and headers
Confirm HTTPS only, no mixed content, HSTS if applicable. Check Content-Type, X-Content-Type-Options, and absence of sensitive server/version leakage.
Input sanitization (read endpoints)
Use harmless special characters in filters (e.g., "';()<>") and confirm no server errors or reflected unsanitized content.
Rate-limit behavior
If documented, approach the limit with controlled bursts. Confirm 429 with Retry-After and graceful recovery afterwards.
PII hygiene (sample data)
Ensure responses do not expose unnecessary PII beyond documented fields.
Contract and Schema Validation

If OpenAPI is available:
Validate responses against schemas and report mismatches (missing/extra fields, type errors, format errors).
Confirm required fields and enum constraints where defined.
If no spec is available:
Infer a provisional schema from sample responses. Validate subsequent calls against this inferred contract to detect drift.
Data Quality and Domain Rules

For scholarship objects, verify reasonable field integrity:
deadline is a valid future/near-future date or clearly labeled if past (for archive endpoints).
amount is numeric and non-negative; currency/units clear.
eligibility fields (GPA/state/major) appear in a consistent format.
description length and encoding are sane (no binary blobs or obvious HTML injection).
Observability Signals

Note any /metrics, /health, or status pages.
Confirm errors surface consistent correlation/request IDs in responses or headers to aid support.
Deliverables (produce at the end)

Executive summary: Go or No-Go with 3–5 bullet reasons.
Endpoint matrix: For each tested route, list method, sample request, status code, schema validation result, p50/p95 latency, and notable headers.
Issues log: Title, severity (Blocker/Major/Minor), endpoint, repro steps, expected vs actual, evidence (screenshots/HAR/snippets).
Recommendations: Quick wins for readiness (e.g., add OpenAPI, fix error schema consistency, enable ETag).
Appendix: HAR files, cURL reproductions, and raw timings.
Execution Notes for the Agent

Work in small, verifiable steps. After each section (Discovery, Functional, Non-Functional, Security), pause and summarize findings before proceeding.
If a critical blocker appears (e.g., persistent 5xx on core endpoints), stop and produce an interim report with evidence.
