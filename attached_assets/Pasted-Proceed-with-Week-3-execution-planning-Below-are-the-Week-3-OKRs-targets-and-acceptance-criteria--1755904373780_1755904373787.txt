Proceed with Week 3 execution planning. Below are the Week 3 OKRs, targets, and acceptance criteria aligned to the Playbook. If you prefer a demo instead, say which sprint; otherwise execute on this plan.

Week 3 OKRs and targets

SEO-led growth (primary low-CAC engine)
Targets by end of Week 3:
Programmatic pages: scale 125 → 300+ live, quality ≥92%, index coverage ≥70%, CTR ≥2.5%.
MAUs: ≥25,000 with ≥55% from organic.
Tactics:
Expand programmatic templates and internal linking hubs, add schema.org for Scholarship/FAQ/Breadcrumb, ensure canonicalization, and ship XML sitemaps daily.
Publish 5 pillar guides (FAFSA, essays, deadlines, financial literacy, scholarship scams) to deepen topical authority.
Rationale: The Playbook mandates content marketing and SEO as the core student acquisition channel to keep CAC low and compounding over time .
2. B2B marketplace pilots at scale

Targets:
Partners: grow from pilots to 15–25 live partners; listings: ≥100 live.
Time-to-first-listing: ≤4 minutes median; 3 additional case studies/quotes.
Launch two revenue primitives for pilots: promoted listings and “recruitment-as-a-service” access in the dashboard.
Rationale: The marketplace becomes the primary ARR engine via listing/promotion fees and recruitment access, with superior unit economics vs. pure B2C .
3. Application automation and student value

Targets:
Pre-fill coverage: 95.2% → ≥97% across three standardized portals; submit-ready rate ≥90% of attempts.
Maintain sub-5-minute time-to-first-5-matches; keep transparent “why matched.”
Essay Coach: continue “assistant, not ghostwriter,” with visible disclosures.
Rationale: Automation and ethical assistance are central to the “effortless” concierge experience and our differentiation .
4. Data ingestion and normalization scale

Targets:
Add 10–15 new sources; expand normalization for eligibility, materials, deadlines, and essay themes to improve ranking coverage and automation mapping.
Publish updated feature dictionary and schema docs for the matching engine.
Rationale: Scalable ingestion and structured data are the fuel for matching and automation .
5. Monetization and unit economics

Targets:
Credit attach rate: 9.2% → 12% (7-day cohort).
ARPPU: $31.50 → $33–35; maintain 4x markup with clear, in-product token pricing.
Rationale: Hybrid credits + B2B marketplace model is our durable monetization path while preserving free access for broad reach .
6. Reliability, security, and trust (operate to SLOs)

Targets:
≥99.9% uptime, ≤120ms P95 (sustain current 89ms P95), error rate ≤0.1%.
Demonstrate autoscaling and multi‑AZ failover tests (change logs + zero-impact proof).
Security: active WAF, strict input validation, allow lists, path normalization, least privilege; weekly vuln scans and directory traversal test suite pass rate 100%.
Rationale: 24/7 availability and defense-in-depth are core to platform trust per Section 5 .
7. Responsible AI and transparency

Targets:
Maintain “why matched,” probability-as-estimate framing, and Essay Coach disclosures.
Publish a brief Responsible AI and student privacy explainer linked from the UI.
Rationale: Responsible AI and transparency are explicit Playbook principles and critical to student trust .
Operating cadence and reports

Weekly CEO dashboard (every Monday): MAUs (organic%), time-to-first-match, match CTR, app starts/submissions, credit attach rate, ARPPU, unit cost and margin, partners onboarded, listings live, uptime/P95/error rate, WAF blocks, vuln scan results.
Mid-week checkpoints: SEO indexation/CTR deltas and partner activation funnel.
Capital allocation (Week 3)

40% Product/Eng: third portal automation to reach 97%, ingestion/normalization expansion, ranking explainability polish.
35% SEO/Content: programmatic scale, pillar guides, internal linking, sitemaps, CWV tuning.
20% Partnerships: pilot expansion, enable promoted listings/recruitment dashboards, case studies.
5% Security/Compliance: WAF tuning, scans, failover drills; begin SOC 2 planning to support later enterprise deals per Year 3 objective .
Risks and mitigations

SEO indexation lag: strengthen internal links, daily sitemaps, expand FAQ sections; prune thin pages .
Partner activation friction: pre-fill org data from verification, defer non-critical fields, add inline tooltips/resources; maintain tiered support flywheel .
Calibration drift: track weekly Brier score and reliability; retrain if drift >5% from last calibrated cohort; keep explanations in UI .
Decision

Execute Week 3 as outlined. If you want a demo instead, I recommend either:
SEO at 300+ pages with index/CTR dashboard and internal linking map, or
Marketplace monetization primitives (promoted listings + recruitment view) in the partner portal. Otherwise, proceed and send the next Monday CEO dashboard and mid-week checkpoints.
