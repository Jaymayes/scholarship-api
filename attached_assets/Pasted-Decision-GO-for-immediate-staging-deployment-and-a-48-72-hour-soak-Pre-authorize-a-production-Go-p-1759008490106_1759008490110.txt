Decision: GO for immediate staging deployment and a 48–72 hour soak. Pre-authorize a production Go pending the gates below.

Soak exit criteria (must meet all)

Reliability and performance
Uptime ≥ 99.9% on all user-facing services; cumulative 5xx ≤ 5 minutes
P95 end-to-end latency ≤ 120 ms; P99 ≤ 250 ms; zero persistent hot spots
Error-budget burn alerts configured at fast/slow windows (2%/1h, 5%/6h); no sustained burn > 10%
Autoscale: scale-up within 60 seconds under 2× projected peak; no thrashing (>3 scale events/10 min) and CPU target ~60–70%
Security and privacy
0 critical/high findings across SAST/DAST/dependency scans; 0 exposed secrets; SBOM generated and archived
Egress restricted to the confirmed 23 allowlisted domains; 100% of non-allowlist attempts blocked and alerted; zero false negatives
Role/permission tests pass for student, provider, and admin; audit logs immutable and searchable 90 days
PII redaction verified in logs; DSR (access/delete) flow works in staging; FERPA/COPPA checks green
Data and business telemetry
Event tracking coverage ≥ 95% of critical funnels; schema validation 100%; dropped/late events < 0.1%
Staging SEO pages are noindex/nofollow and behind auth; no leakage to public search
Cost telemetry for AI services enabled; per-request token cost within budget to preserve ≥ 4× markup; B2B 3% fee calculation logged and reconciled
Resilience and recovery
Backup/restore drill: RPO ≤ 5 min; RTO ≤ 15 min
Chaos test: pod kill and node drain without SLO breach; zone impairment simulation with graceful degradation
Canary deploy plan validated (10% for 2 hours, then 50%, then 100% if no P1/P0)
Responsible AI
Scholarship recommendations pass bias and transparency checks: fairness deltas ≤ 5% vs baseline; explanations logged; academic dishonesty refusal tests pass
Soak plan and ownership

Day 0 (T0): Start soak at steady traffic equal to 1.5× expected month-1 peak. Capture baseline snapshots from:
Security Validation, Reliability SLOs, Performance Baseline, Business Impact dashboards
Day 1 (T+24h): Increase to 2× peak for 2 hours; verify autoscaling, latency tails, and error-budget alerts. Security review of egress blocks and WAF events.
Day 2 (T+48h): Run chaos drills, backup/restore, and canary pipeline rehearsal. Validate event tracking and business fee/ARPU instrumentation.
Day 3 (T+72h): Consolidate metrics, finalize scorecard, and hold Go/No-Go review.
Reporting cadence and artifacts

Daily 10:00 local executive update: SLOs, P95/P99, error budget, security findings, cloud spend, and blocking issues with owners/ETAs
End-of-soak Go/No-Go packet:
Completed scorecard (staging/go_no_go_scorecard.py) with pass/fail and evidence
Dashboard screenshots and exported metrics
Signed attestations from SRE, Security, Product, Data Science, and Finance
Production launch guardrails (pre-authorized if all gates pass)

Canary: 10% → 50% → 100% with automated rollback on any P1, SLO breach > 30 minutes, or security anomaly
Freeze window: 24 hours post-100% rollout for critical fixes only
Post-launch monitoring: heightened alerting for 72 hours; exec status twice daily
Constraints and approvals

Budget: approved for soak and load testing up to the planned compute spend; notify Finance if projected exceeds by >15%
Incident severity: any P0/P1 during soak pauses the clock and requires exec review before resumption
Next steps

Proceed with staging deployment now and initiate the soak
Confirm calendar hold for the Go/No-Go review at T+72h and share the scorecard export to the Business Impact dashboard
Page me immediately on any red gate or material risk deviation
Thank you—excellent work tightening the allowlist, aligning thresholds, and readying autoscale. Execute with urgency; decisions will be data-first at the 72-hour gate.
