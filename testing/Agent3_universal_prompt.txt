Universal Read-Only E2E Test Prompt for Agent3

Prime Objective

Evaluate the readiness of each Scholar AI Advisor app for production by running only read-only, non-mutating tests.
Do not change any data, configuration, or state. Do not submit forms, perform POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests, or trigger side effects.
Produce a structured report of findings and a readiness score for each app.

Scope

Auto Com Center: https://auto-com-center-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Scholarship Agent: https://scholarship-agent-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Scholarship Sage: https://scholarship-sage-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Scholarship API: https://scholarship-api-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Student Pilot: https://student-pilot-jamarrlmayes.replit.app
Provider Register: https://provider-register-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Scholar Auth: https://scholar-auth-jamarrlmayes.replit.app

Instructions: use only the relevant section per app

Frontend Web App (public): Auto Page Maker, Scholarship Agent, Scholarship Sage, Provider Register
Frontend Web App (authenticated): Student Pilot
API/Backend Service: Scholarship API
Auth Service: Scholar Auth
Internal/Admin Dashboard: Auto Com Center

Global read-only guardrails

Allowed HTTP methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS only.
Do not authenticate or submit any credentials unless explicit test-only credentials are provided.
Do not submit any forms; intercept and prevent all form submissions.
Treat 3xx responses as success if navigation completes.
Capture screenshots and headers for evidence; collect console errors. Do not store PII.

Core evidence to collect (every app)

Availability: HTTP status (200–399), DNS/TLS reachable
Performance: client-side TTFB and DOMContentLoaded timing (best effort)
Console errors: count and examples
Security headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
SEO (public pages): title, meta description, canonical, robots meta, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
Accessibility spot-check: main landmarks, alt attributes for above-the-fold images

Per-app relevant checks

Public frontend: landing loads <~3s, no blocking console errors, basic SEO present, key GET-only nav works, no mixed-content
Authenticated frontend: login UI visible, protected routes redirect to login, privacy/terms visible
API service: GET /, /health, /status, /metrics (read-only), OpenAPI doc accessible, CORS headers reasonable, JSON types correct
Auth service: login UI loads, reset/signup links visible, cookies flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) if set, CSRF token present (no submission)
Internal/Admin: dashboard loads, read-only sections render, charts render without console errors

Deliverables

App-by-app report: Availability, Perf snapshot, Security headers, Console errors, SEO/accessibility as applicable
Issues: categorized High/Medium/Low
Readiness score (0–5): 0 Not reachable; 1 Major blockers; 2 Critical issues; 3 Usable non-critical issues; 4 Near-ready; 5 Production-ready

How to execute

Use the provided bundle:
Frontend smoke via Playwright: frontend/tests/smoke.spec.js
Backend read-only checks via pytest: backend/tests/test_readonly_endpoints.py
Initial readiness probe: reporting/generate_readiness_report.py
Run on a workstation with internet access.
Export findings into reporting/report_template.md as report_<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>.md
Do not attempt POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.

Output format

Single Markdown report with summary table, per-app evidence, and final readiness scores. No changes proposed—report only.
