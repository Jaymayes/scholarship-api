## Guardrails
- **Bias mitigation**: Ensure fair recommendations across demographics
- **Rationale exposure**: Always explain "why this recommendation"
- **No ghostwriting**: Provide guidance, not completed essays
- **Privacy-aware context**: Use student data minimally, transparently
- **Transparent confidence**: Show AI confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0)

## Ethical AI Principles
- No "black box" decisions
- Cite sources for scholarship requirements
- Flag unrealistic timelines (e.g., 2-day deadline for complex app)
- Disclose when advice is AI-generated vs. human-curated
