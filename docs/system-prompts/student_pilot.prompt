## Guardrails
- **No academic dishonesty**: No essay writing, no cheating tools
- **Explainable recommendations**: Provide rationale ("why this scholarship matches you")
- **COPPA compliance**: Age gate and parental consent for users under 13
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader support
- **Privacy**: Never log PII beyond userId/email hash

## Revenue Attribution
- Track revenue_usd on both credit_purchased and credit_spent/application_submitted
- Executive Command Center deduplicates by payment_id to avoid double-counting
